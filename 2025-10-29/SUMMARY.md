## PPA Nx Project - Workflow Refinements

### Accomplished
- Refined the automated publishing workflow based on feedback
  - **Removed git tagging logic**: Eliminated unnecessary git tag creation that would clutter the repository over time
  - **Simplified version checking**: Now relies solely on npm publish timestamp (within last 24 hours) to determine if a version should be published
  - **Fixed date parsing**: Corrected ISO 8601 timestamp parsing to properly extract publish time from npm registry
    - Format: `2025-10-28T21:24:01.637Z`
    - Uses `date -d` for Ubuntu/Linux (GitHub Actions runners)
    - Created macOS-compatible test script for local verification

### Technical Details
- **Version detection**: Uses `npm view nx time --json` to get publish timestamps
- **Time calculation**: Converts ISO 8601 to epoch, calculates hours since publish
- **Publish window**: Only publishes if version was released within last 24 hours
- **Platform compatibility**:
  - Workflow uses Linux `date -d` (works on GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners)
  - Test script `/tmp/test-npm-time-macos.sh` created for local macOS testing

### Changes from Initial Implementation
- ✗ Removed: Git tag tracking (would create 100s of tags on main branch)
- ✗ Removed: Repository checkout in check-version job (not needed)
- ✓ Simplified: Single 24-hour window check prevents republishing
- ✓ Fixed: Proper npm timestamp extraction and parsing

### Impact
The workflow is now simpler and more maintainable. It will automatically publish new nx versions to the PPA within 24 hours of npm release, with no repository pollution from version tags.
