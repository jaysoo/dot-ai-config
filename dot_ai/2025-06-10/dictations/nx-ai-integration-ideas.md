# Nx AI Integration Ideas

## Random Thoughts on AI and Nx

These are initial thoughts about how Nx should integrate with AI tools and what capabilities it should provide out of the box.

## Generators vs AI-Powered Code Generation

The current generator system in Nx has limitations compared to AI-powered tools like Claude Code:

- **Traditional Generators**: Can only show you a diff of what will happen with no way to modify the output except through predefined options
- **AI Experience**: Superior because you can:
  - Preview what the AI will generate
  - Approve or reject changes before committing
  - Ask for modifications and different approaches
  - Have a conversational workflow to refine the output

The AI experience is fundamentally more flexible and powerful than static generators with fixed options.

## MCP Server Integration

Currently, the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Nx is distributed as a separate package. This raises the question:

**Shouldn't the MCP server be part of the Nx CLI tool itself?**

Benefits of integrating MCP into the core CLI:
- Users could start the MCP server directly as part of the core CLI offerings
- No need for separate package installation
- Better out-of-the-box AI experience

## Next Steps

These are initial thoughts that will be expanded upon. The plan is to:
- Capture more ideas as they come
- Loop everything together later
- Tie these concepts into a cohesive AI strategy for Nx
