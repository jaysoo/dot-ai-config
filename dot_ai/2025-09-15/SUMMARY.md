## 🎯 Main Accomplishments

### DOC-185: Add API Documentation for Core Nx Packages
- **Branch**: DOC-185 (nx-worktrees)
- **Commit**: 776ea2b5f2 - docs(misc): add API docs for nx, workspace, web, plugin
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

#### Work Completed:
1. **Created API documentation pages** for core Nx packages:
   - `/reference/nx` - Main Nx package API docs with executors, generators, and migrations
   - `/reference/workspace` - Workspace utilities API documentation
   - `/reference/web` - Web development utilities API docs
   - `/reference/plugin` - Plugin development API documentation

2. **Updated redirect rules** to point old API URLs to new locations:
   - Mapped `/reference/core-api/*` paths to new `/reference/{package}/*` structure
   - Fixed redirect rules for executors, generators, and migrations for each package
   - Ensured all individual generator/executor pages redirect to consolidated pages

3. **Fixed broken link validation issues**:
   - Resolved `/docs/undefined` links appearing in troubleshooting pages
   - Added robust error handling to `sidebar-reference-updater.middleware.ts`
   - Fixed content collection loading issues for nx-reference-packages
   - Validation now passes with 0 broken links (was failing with multiple undefined links)

## 📊 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- Created 8 new Astro page files for API documentation
- Updated `nx-dev/nx-dev/redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js` with ~40 redirect mappings
- Fixed `astro-docs/src/plugins/sidebar-reference-updater.middleware.ts` with error handling
- Added 16 deprecated documentation files with proper redirects

### Key Fixes:
- Prevented undefined slug errors in sidebar generation
- Added try-catch error handling for missing content collections
- Filtered out entries without valid slug data
- Made sidebar generation more resilient to missing content

## 🔄 Current State
- PR ready with all API documentation pages functional
- Link validation passing (630 routes validated successfully)
- Redirect rules properly configured for old API paths
- Sidebar dynamically updates with available API documentation

## 📝 Notes
- The nx-reference-packages content collection loader runs during build to generate content
- Some warnings about slug params remain but don't affect functionality
- The solution gracefully handles cases where generators/executors/migrations don't exist for a package
