# Daily Summary - 2025-09-19

## Branch: DOC-221

### Work Completed
- Added Algolia search functionality to blog index page when Astro docs are enabled
- Ensured blog search is preserved during Astro migration

### Implementation Details

#### Files Modified
- `nx-dev/feature-search/src/lib/algolia-search.tsx` - Added `blogOnly` prop to filter search to blog posts
- `nx-dev/ui-blog/package.json` - Added `@nx/nx-dev-feature-search` dependency
- `nx-dev/ui-blog/src/lib/blog-container.tsx` - Integrated AlgoliaSearch component with conditional rendering based on NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL
- `nx-dev/ui-blog/src/lib/filters.tsx` - Minor styling adjustment for filter text size
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new dependency

### Key Decisions
- Used Algolia facet filtering with `hierarchy.lvl0:Nx | Blog` to restrict search to blog posts only
- Positioned search box on the right side of the filters for better UX
- Only shows blog search when NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL is set (Astro migration mode)

### Notes
- Remembered to run `nx sync` after modifying package.json dependencies (caught by user)
- Search placeholder text changes to "Search blog posts" when in blog-only mode
