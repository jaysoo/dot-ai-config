# Daily Summary - 2025-08-19

## Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Review Linear Stale Issues for Nx CLI Team (08:50)
  - Plan created: `tasks/linear-stale-issues-review.md`
  - Goal: Identify and review stale issues in Linear that haven't been updated in 3+ months
  - Findings: 6 In Progress issues and multiple Backlog issues are stale
  - Architecture updated: Created `architectures/dot-ai-config-architecture.md`
  - Next steps: Review with assignees, close/update stale issues

- [x] Docker Tagging and Publishing Investigation (11:13)
  - Plan created: `tasks/docker-tagging-publishing-investigation.md`
  - Goal: Understand complete Docker tagging, pushing, and publishing flow
  - Key discovery: CalVer scheme (yymm.dd.build-number) in build-and-publish-to-snapshot.sh
  - Architecture updated: Added Docker versioning system to ocean-architecture.md
  - Deliverable: Complete flow documentation with modification guide

- [x] Nx Release Docker Migration (Failed First Attempt) (13:00-17:30)
  - Plan created: `tasks/migrate-to-nx-release-docker.md` 
  - Goal: Switch Docker tagging/publishing to use nx release with @nx/docker
  - **Mistake:** Over-engineered with Dockerfile symlinks and restructuring
  - **Learning:** User wanted MINIMAL changes, not structural overhaul
  - **Result:** Had to revert changes and understand correct approach
  - **Corrected:** Created minimal plan focusing on command replacement only

## Key Findings

### Linear Stale Issues Analysis
- **6 In Progress issues** haven't been updated in 3+ months (oldest from Nov 2024)
- **Multiple Backlog issues** from early 2024 need re-evaluation
- Critical assignees with multiple stale issues:
  - Craigory Coppola: 3 stale In Progress, 2 old Backlog
  - Jack Hsu: 2 high-priority In Progress with Aug 22 due dates
  - Colum Ferry: Multiple 15+ month old Backlog issues

### High Priority Actions
- NXC-2950 and NXC-2493: Due Aug 22 but no updates since Feb/May
- NXC-1209: 8 months old In Progress issue (parallel daemon requests)
- NXC-293: 18 months old Backlog issue (oldest found)

## Tasks (Continued)

### Completed
- [x] Review Linear Stale Issues for Nx Cloud Team (15:45)
  - Plan created: `tasks/nx-cloud-stale-issues-review.md`
  - Goal: Identify stale issues for Nx Cloud team (not Nx CLI team)
  - Findings: **0 stale issues** - All issues updated within last 3 months
  - Corrected calculation: Stale = last updated May 19, 2025 or earlier
  - Conclusion: Nx Cloud team has excellent issue hygiene, no action needed

## Docker Build System Investigation

### Current Implementation
- **CalVer Format:** `yymm.dd.<build-number>` (e.g., 2508.19.4)
- **Main Script:** `tools/build-and-publish-to-snapshot.sh` (lines 22-31 for versioning)
- **Dockerfiles:** Centralized in `apps/docker-setup/dockerfiles/`
- **Images Built:** 9 Docker images (nx-api, file-server, aggregator, etc.)
- **Registries:** GAR (primary), Quay (secondary), DockerHub (public releases)

### Migration Lessons Learned
1. **Over-engineering:** Initially tried to restructure project with symlinks
2. **Minimal changes principle:** User wants SAME structure, just different commands
3. **Custom targets approach:** Can use `nx:run-commands` instead of @nx/docker inference
4. **Ready for next session:** Minimal implementation script created

### Files for Next Implementation
- **Task plan:** `tasks/minimal-nx-release-docker-plan.md`
- **Implementation script:** `tasks/minimal-docker-implementation.mjs`
- **CalVer generator:** `tasks/calver-version-generator.mjs`

- [x] DOC-121: Search Quality Comparison (18:00-22:30)
  - Plan created: `tasks/search-quality-comparison.md`
  - Goal: Compare search quality between production nx.dev and Astro preview site
  - **Initial mistake:** Created 75-keyword test suite instead of using Ocean's 35 keywords
  - **Corrected:** Used exact Ocean script keywords from `~/projects/ocean/tools/scripts/scorecards/nx-dev-search-score.ts`
  - **Key discovery:** Both sites perform nearly identically (6.67 vs 6.48 Ocean scores)
  - **Major insight:** Initial 0.00/10.0 Astro score was due to overly strict URL matching
  - **Final results:** Production (6.67), Astro (6.48) - virtually tied
  - **Files generated:** 
    - `DOC-121-COMPLETE-DATA.md` - All 35 keywords with top 3 URLs
    - `intelligent-search-comparison.mjs` - Content analysis against mdoc files
    - `astro-recalculated-scores.json` - Corrected scoring methodology
  - **Architecture impact:** Learned importance of flexible URL matching for search quality assessment

## Summary

Successfully completed 4 major tasks today with significant learning outcomes:

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Linear Issue Management**: Analyzed stale issues across both Nx CLI and Nx Cloud teams, revealing excellent hygiene for Cloud team (0 stale issues) vs CLI team needing attention (6 In Progress + multiple Backlog issues requiring review).

2. **Docker System Understanding**: Documented complete CalVer-based Docker build and publishing system, establishing foundation for future nx release migration.

3. **Search Quality Assessment**: Completed comprehensive DOC-121 comparison showing production and Astro preview sites are virtually tied (6.67 vs 6.48 Ocean scores), with key insight that initial 0.00 score was due to overly strict URL matching rather than poor content.

4. **Knowledge Management**: Updated CLAUDE.md with critical learnings about Ocean script integration, intelligent URL matching, and content analysis to prevent similar mistakes in future search quality tasks.

### Key Technical Insights

- **Ocean Methodology**: Always use exact Ocean script keywords (35 official) rather than creating custom keyword sets
- **URL Matching Intelligence**: Path variants like `/reference/` vs `/references/` and Introduction pages vs API pages should be considered equivalent or better
- **Content vs Search Gap**: Sites may have rich content that isn't properly indexed/searchable, requiring separate analysis
- **Minimal Changes Principle**: For system migrations, focus on command replacement rather than structural reorganization

### Files for Follow-up

- `tasks/minimal-nx-release-docker-plan.md` - Ready for Docker migration implementation
- `tasks/DOC-121-COMPLETE-DATA.md` - Complete comparison data for decision making
- `tasks/manual-review-needed.json` - 9 ambiguous URL cases requiring human judgment
