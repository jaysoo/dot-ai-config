## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Review all "In Progress" issues that are 3+ months old
   - NXC-2950 and NXC-2493 have due dates of August 22, 2025 but haven't been updated in months

2. **Assignee Review**:
   - **Craigory Coppola**: Has 3 stale In Progress issues (NXC-1209, NXC-1514, NXC-2588)
   - **Jack Hsu**: Has 2 high-priority stale issues with upcoming due dates
   - **Colum Ferry**: Has multiple very old backlog issues from 2024

3. **Consider for Closure/Deprioritization**:
   - Issues from early 2024 in backlog may no longer be relevant
   - Low priority issues that are 6+ months old

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review each In Progress issue with assignees
- [ ] Update or close stale backlog issues from 2024
- [ ] Check if high-priority issues with due dates are still relevant
- [ ] Consider implementing a regular stale issue review process
