# Search Quality Comparison Based on Important Keywords

## Task Overview

Compare the quality of search results in Nx documentation based on important keywords to ensure users can find relevant information efficiently.

## Context

- The Nx documentation uses Algolia for search (found in `nx-dev/feature-search/src/lib/algolia-search.tsx`)
- Documentation files contain `keywords` in their frontmatter (e.g., `docs/shared/packages/angular/angular-plugin.md`)
- Search index: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_INDEX`
- Current search parameters: `facetFilters: ['language:en']`, `hitsPerPage: 100`, `distinct: true`

## Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Data Collection

#### Step 1: Identify Important Keywords
- **TODO:**
  - [x] Scan all documentation files for existing keywords in frontmatter
  - [ ] Create a script to extract all keywords from documentation
  - [ ] Categorize keywords by frequency and importance
  - [ ] Identify missing keywords in critical documentation

**Script location:** `.ai/2025-08-19/tasks/extract-keywords.mjs`

#### Step 2: Define Search Quality Metrics
- **TODO:**
  - [ ] Define relevance scoring criteria
  - [ ] Create precision/recall metrics for keyword searches
  - [ ] Establish ranking quality metrics
  - [ ] Define user intent categories (e.g., getting started, API reference, troubleshooting)

**Metrics to track:**
- Precision: How many results are relevant to the keyword
- Recall: How many relevant documents are found
- Ranking: Are the most relevant results appearing first
- Coverage: Are all important topics discoverable

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Step 3: Build Search Quality Testing Framework
- **TODO:**
  - [ ] Create test suite for common search queries
  - [ ] Implement Algolia API client for programmatic testing
  - [ ] Build comparison tool for before/after keyword improvements
  - [ ] Generate search quality reports

**Script location:** `.ai/2025-08-19/tasks/search-quality-tester.mjs`

#### Step 4: Keyword Optimization
- **TODO:**
  - [ ] Analyze search patterns from user data (if available)
  - [ ] Add missing keywords to documentation files
  - [ ] Create keyword consistency guidelines
  - [ ] Implement keyword validation in CI/CD

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

#### Step 5: Run Quality Comparisons
- **TODO:**
  - [ ] Execute baseline search quality tests
  - [ ] Apply keyword improvements
  - [ ] Re-run tests to measure improvement
  - [ ] Generate comparison report

#### Step 6: Documentation and Rollout
- **TODO:**
  - [ ] Document keyword best practices
  - [ ] Create contributor guidelines for keywords
  - [ ] Set up monitoring for search quality metrics
  - [ ] Plan gradual rollout of improvements

## Technical Approach

### 1. Keyword Extraction Script
```javascript
// Extract all keywords from docs
// Group by frequency and document type
// Identify gaps in keyword coverage
```

### 2. Search Quality Tester
```javascript
// Test searches for each important keyword
// Measure relevance of results
// Compare rankings
// Generate quality scores
```

### 3. Comparison Framework
```javascript
// Before/after comparison of search results
// Visual diff of result rankings
// Statistical analysis of improvements
```

## Key Considerations

1. **Search Index Configuration**: Review Algolia index settings for optimization opportunities
2. **Keyword Consistency**: Ensure similar concepts use consistent keywords
3. **User Intent**: Map keywords to user intentions and journey stages
4. **Performance**: Balance keyword density with readability
5. **Maintenance**: Create sustainable process for keyword management

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical documentation pages have appropriate keywords
- [ ] Search precision improves by at least 20%
- [ ] Top 5 results for important queries are always relevant
- [ ] Reduced user complaints about search functionality
- [ ] Established monitoring for ongoing search quality

## Next Steps

1. Start with Step 1: Create keyword extraction script
2. Analyze current keyword coverage
3. Define specific quality metrics based on findings
4. Implement testing framework
5. Run comparisons and iterate
