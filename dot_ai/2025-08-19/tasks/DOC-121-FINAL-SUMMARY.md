# DOC-121: Search Quality Comparison - Final Results

**Task**: Compare search quality between production nx.dev and Astro preview site  
**Method**: Ocean scoring methodology (35 official keywords, position-based scoring)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## Bottom Line Results

| Site | Ocean Score | Coverage | Perfect Results | Winner |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Production** (nx.dev) | **6.67/10.0** | 71.4% | 60.0% | üèÜ |
| **Astro Preview** (nx-docs.netlify.app) | **6.48/10.0** | 74.3% | 54.3% | ü•à |

**Gap**: Production leads by only **0.19 points** (virtually tied)

## Key Findings

‚úÖ **Both sites perform well** - much closer than initially expected  
‚úÖ **Astro has better coverage** (74.3% vs 71.4%) but fewer perfect matches  
‚úÖ **Production excels at commands/concepts**, Astro better at frameworks/tools  
‚ö†Ô∏è **9 keywords still need manual review** for final scoring decisions

## Category Performance

| Category | Production | Astro | Better Site |
|----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Commands | 10.0/10.0 | ~5.0/10.0 | Production |
| Features | 9.33/10.0 | ~8.0/10.0 | Production |
| Concepts | 10.0/10.0 | ~7.5/10.0 | Production |
| Reference | 10.0/10.0 | 10.0/10.0 | **Tie** |
| Frameworks | 1.67/10.0 | 10.0/10.0 | **Astro** |
| Tools | 1.43/10.0 | 9.0/10.0 | **Astro** |
| API | 8.89/10.0 | 7.5/10.0 | Production |

## Recommendations

**Short-term**: Continue using **production site** (slight edge + proven stability)

**Medium-term**: 
- Fix production framework/tool coverage gaps
- Improve Astro command documentation search ranking

**Long-term**: Consider **hybrid approach**:
- Production for commands/concepts/core features
- Astro for framework-specific documentation

## Files Generated

- `DOC-121-final-results.json` - Complete test data
- `astro-recalculated-scores.json` - Corrected Astro scoring  
- `manual-review-needed.json` - 9 ambiguous cases for review

## Manual Review Needed

9 keywords need human judgment on URL equivalency:
- `init`, `import`, `build`, `serve`, `lint` (command documentation structure differences)
- `affected`, `release`, `update` (path/naming variations)
- `docker` (Astro found better content than expected)

**Action**: Review these 9 cases to finalize scoring - could push Astro ahead if deemed equivalent.

---
**Conclusion**: Sites are essentially equivalent in search quality. Choice should be based on other factors (maintenance, features, team preference).
