# Linear Stale Issues Review for Nx Cloud Team

**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Purpose**: Identify stale issues in Linear for the Nx Cloud team that haven't been updated in over 3 months (since May 19, 2025 or earlier)

## Summary

After correcting the date calculation (3+ months ago = May 19, 2025 or earlier), the findings show:
- **0 stale issues** - All Nx Cloud team issues have been updated within the last 3 months
- All Backlog and In Progress issues have recent activity

## Analysis Results

### Backlog Issues
All Backlog issues have been updated recently (June 2025 or later). None are stale.

### In Progress Issues  
All In Progress issues are actively being worked on with recent updates. None are stale.

### Todo Issues
All Todo issues have been updated recently. None are stale.

## Key Finding

The Nx Cloud team appears to be actively maintaining their issue backlog with regular updates. Even the oldest issues in the backlog have been touched within the last 3 months, indicating good hygiene in issue management.

## Recommendations

1. **No immediate action required** - The team is actively maintaining their issues
2. **Continue current practices** - Regular updates to issues are preventing staleness
3. **Monitor for future** - Consider setting up alerts for issues approaching 3 months without updates

## Next Steps

- [ ] No stale issues to review
- [ ] Consider implementing automated alerts for issues approaching 3 months without updates
- [ ] Review again in 1-2 months to ensure continued good hygiene

## CRITICAL: Implementation Tracking

When implementing or executing on this task, keep track of progress in this document.

## Note on Initial Error

Initially searched for issues and incorrectly identified many as stale because I misunderstood the date threshold. Issues updated in June, July, or August 2025 are NOT stale when today is August 19, 2025. Only issues last updated on or before May 19, 2025 would be considered stale (3+ months old).
