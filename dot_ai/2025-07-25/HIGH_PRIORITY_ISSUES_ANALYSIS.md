## Recommendations

Since all high priority issues are assigned:

1. **Monitor Stale Assignments**
   - Check issues not updated in 30+ days
   - Look for "help wanted" comments from assignees

2. **Focus on Other Priority Levels**
   - Search for unassigned "priority: medium" issues
   - Look for "good first issue" labels

3. **Support Assigned Issues**
   - Offer to help with reproductions
   - Provide test cases or additional debugging

4. **Create Workspace Issues**
   - High volume suggests systematic problem
   - Could benefit from comprehensive testing matrix

## Next Steps

```bash
# Find medium priority unassigned issues
gh issue list -R nrwl/nx -s open -L 100 --label "priority: medium" --search "no:assignee"

# Find issues with "help wanted" label
gh issue list -R nrwl/nx -s open -L 100 --label "help wanted"

# Find stale high priority issues (no update in 30 days)
gh issue list -R nrwl/nx -s open --label "priority: high" --search "updated:<2025-06-25"
```
