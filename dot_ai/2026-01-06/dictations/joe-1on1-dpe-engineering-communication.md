# 1:1 with Joe - DPE/Engineering Communication Gap

**Date:** 2026-01-06

## Topic

Bridging the gap between DPE/Customer Success and Engineering teams - addressing communication issues.

## Questions to Discuss

### Understanding the Pain Points

- What are the **concrete pain points** currently being discussed or presented on the Customer Success side?

### Identifying Where Visibility is Lacking

Is the communication gap related to:

1. **Initial planning** - Should future planning be communicated earlier?
2. **Wrap-up/completion** - Is there a lack of communication for completed features?
3. **Roadmap clarity** - Is the overall roadmap not visible enough?

Where exactly are the areas we should make **more visible**?

## Discussion Notes

The main gap is between what the engineering team has done (particularly bug fixes) and what Customer Success is waiting for - either for SaaS customers via support email or from different customers.

### Key Metric

**Time to Resolution:** From initial customer/user contact to circling back with them (not just fix + deploy, but the full communication loop).

This is a concrete metric we can track. We need to develop more metrics to show we're moving in the right direction.

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Due |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Joe | Look into how to get the stat from initial email to resolution email | Next week |
| Jack | Follow up with Steven and Caleb in 1:1s for their ideas | TBD |
| All | Circle back on metric tracking | Next week |

## Follow-ups for Steven & Caleb (in their 1:1s)

- What are their ideas for bridging the gap between engineering and Customer Success?
- How can we better communicate when bug fixes are deployed?
- Which versions fixed specific bugs (support email context)
- What other metrics would help show we're moving in the right direction?

## Goals

### Short-term

- Establish baseline metric for time-to-resolution
- Identify quick wins for visibility improvements

### H1 2026

- TBD based on follow-up discussions

### Full Year 2026

- TBD based on follow-up discussions
