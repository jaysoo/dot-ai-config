### L4 to L5 Strategic Thinking Guidance

**File**: `.ai/2026-01-29/specs/l4-to-l5-strategic-thinking-guidance.md`

Brainstormed and created a self-assessment guide for L4 engineers to understand and demonstrate L5-level strategic thinking.

**Key insights captured:**
- Core mindset shift: "L4s deliver success when guided. L5s ensure success independently."
- L5s propose projects based on research, customer feedback, and data analysis
- L5s own the full lifecycle: ship → instrument → monitor weekly → iterate
- SME status is earned organically through sustained work and solving hard problems
- Anti-patterns: ship and forget, waiting to be told, buggy/incomplete delivery

**Concrete example included**: Engineer who noticed pipeline issues via Grafana → talked to customers → proposed Docker layer caching and registry mirroring → delivered dual impact (faster pipelines + lower infra costs).

**Format**: Self-assessment questions for each L5 expectation, designed for L4s to identify gaps and have informed EM conversations. Explicitly not a checkbox formula to avoid gaming.
