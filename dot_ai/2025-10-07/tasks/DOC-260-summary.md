# DOC-260 Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Issue**: https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-260/update-tailwindcss-guides

## Changes Made

Updated Tailwind CSS documentation in `astro-docs` to remove generator references and provide manual setup instructions that work with Tailwind v3 and v4.

### Files Modified

1. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/technologies/angular/Guides/using-tailwind-css-with-angular-projects.mdoc`
2. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/technologies/react/Guides/using-tailwind-css-in-react.mdoc`

### Key Changes

#### Removed
- All references to `@nx/angular:setup-tailwind` and `@nx/react:setup-tailwind` generators
- All references to `--add-tailwind` flag in app/lib generators
- Usage of `createGlobPatternsForDependencies` utility from `@nx/angular/tailwind` and `@nx/react/tailwind`

#### Added
- Manual setup instructions with 5 clear steps
- Support for both Tailwind v3 and v4 configurations
- Simple glob patterns instead of utility functions (e.g., `join(__dirname, '../../libs/**/*.{ts,html}')`)
- Tailwind v4 specific configuration using `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Clear guidance on adjusting glob patterns based on workspace structure

### Benefits

1. **Version agnostic**: Users can now use Tailwind v4 without waiting for Nx generator updates
2. **Simpler**: Manual setup takes ~2 minutes and doesn't rely on generators
3. **More flexible**: Users can easily customize the setup to their needs
4. **Better understanding**: Manual steps help users understand how Tailwind works in their project

### Verification

Created test workspace with Tailwind v4 at `tmp/claude/tailwind-test` and verified:
- Installation works with `npm add -D tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/postcss@next autoprefixer`
- PostCSS config correctly uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` for v4
- Simple glob patterns work for content configuration
- Build succeeds with the manual setup

## Next Steps

The documentation is ready for review. Users can now:
- Set up Tailwind v3 or v4 manually in 2 minutes
- Use simple glob patterns without needing Nx-specific utilities
- Not wait for Nx to update generators for new Tailwind versions
