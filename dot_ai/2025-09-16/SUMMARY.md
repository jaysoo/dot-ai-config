## Task: DOC-209 - Update header to links

### Branch: DOC-209

### Work Performed
Updated header navigation menu items and added sidebar links for the Nx documentation site.

### Files Modified
- `nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/headers/menu-items.ts`
  - Updated "Step by step tutorials" to point to `/docs/getting-started/tutorials` (with conditional path based on NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL)
  - Removed "Office Hours" from Events section (no longer active)
  - Removed "Code examples for your stack" from Learn section (stale content)

- `astro-docs/src/plugins/sidebar-reference-updater.middleware.ts`
  - Added Plugin Registry link pointing to `/docs/plugin-registry`
  - Added Changelog link pointing to `/changelog` (remains on Next.js)
  - Updated `desiredSectionOrder` to position new links above "Releases"

### Key Decisions
- Used conditional paths based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL` environment variable to support both Astro and Next.js deployments
- Changelog remains on Next.js for now, will need to be ignored in validate link script
- Plugin Registry is on Astro site

### Commits
- `8d4b7c352c` - docs(misc): update header menu items per Linear task DOC-209
- `160b0a7cab` - docs(misc): add Plugin Registry and Changelog links to sidebar
- `ef899b1a28` - fix(misc): add conditional path for tutorials link based on NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL

### Mistakes & Learnings
1. **Initial confusion about which header to update** - I initially modified the Astro header (`astro-docs/src/components/layout/Header.astro`) when the task was actually about updating the Next.js header menu items
2. **Missed environment variable check** - Initially hardcoded the `/docs/` prefix without checking `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL`
3. **Sidebar structure confusion** - Initially tried to modify `sidebar.mts` directly instead of the middleware that processes it
