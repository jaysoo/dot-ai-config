# Make Your Builds 10x Faster

Nx understands your code and only runs what's needed.

## See It In Action

{% terminal-demo %}
```bash
# Before Nx
$ npm run build
Building project... â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ 100% (45 seconds)

# After Nx  
$ npm run build
Building project... â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ 100% (4 seconds - cached)
```
{% /terminal-demo %}

## Get Started in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Nx
brew install nx

# 2. Add to your project
nx init

# 3. Run your first cached build
nx build
```

âœ¨ **That's it!** Your builds are now cached and will run up to 10x faster.

## What Just Happened?

Nx analyzed your project and:
- âš¡ Created a task graph of your dependencies
- ðŸ’¾ Cached the results of your build
- ðŸš€ Will skip unchanged work on future runs
