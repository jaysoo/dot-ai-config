# Nx Documentation Site - Getting Started Experience Improvement

## Executive Summary

The Nx getting started experience currently prioritizes comprehensiveness over clarity. While the depth is valuable for existing users, it creates barriers for newcomers. The new focus should shift to immediate value demonstration, followed by progressive disclosure of advanced features.

**Goal**: Get users to their first "wow" experience as quickly as possible, rather than showing everything Nx can do upfront.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify the Intro Page (Highest Impact)

Create a single, streamlined page that includes:
- Nx installation using Homebrew and other package managers
- `nx init` command walkthrough
- Add a video demonstrating caching and orchestration in action
- Target: Users can see value within 2 minutes

### Phase 2: Restructure Getting Started Section

Implement a progressive disclosure path where:
- Users can follow paths specific to their technology stack (e.g., React)
- Show framework-specific content and examples
- Guide users through relevant features based on their chosen path

### Phase 3: Build Advanced Resources

- Create interactive demos
- Develop technology-specific landing pages
- Build comprehensive migration guides for scenarios where `nx init` isn't sufficient

## Success Metrics

1. **Time to First Value**
   - Target: < 5 minutes (ideally 2 minutes)
   - Measure how quickly users understand and experience Nx's value

2. **Bounce Rate**
   - Track users who leave the intro page without proceeding to subsequent pages
   - Identify friction points in the initial experience

3. **Completion Rate**
   - Measure how many users complete the getting started journey
   - Track drop-off points to identify areas for improvement

4. **Framework-Specific Adoption**
   - Track downloads and usage by framework
   - Identify which framework paths are most effective
   - Use data to optimize content for popular frameworks
