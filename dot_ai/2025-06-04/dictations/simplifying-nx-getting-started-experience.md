# Simplifying the Nx Getting Started Experience

## Overview

This project focuses on simplifying the getting started experience with Nx tooling, specifically targeting new users rather than existing users who are already familiar with the system.

## Core Problem

The bottom line is that the current getting started experience prioritizes comprehensiveness over clarity. While this depth is valuable for existing users, it creates significant barriers for newcomers.

## Solution Approach

**Key principles:**
- Shift focus to immediate value demonstration
- Implement progressive disclosure
- Don't show everything Nx can do upfront
- Get users to their first "wow moment" as quickly as possible
- Guide users deeper based on their specific needs (framework/language)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify the Intro Page

Create a single, streamlined intro page under the getting started section that:

1. **Installation** - Simple installation using:
   ```bash
   brew install nx
   # or
   npm install -g nx
   ```

2. **Quick Start** - Run `nx init`

3. **Immediate Value** - Demonstrate value in under 2 minutes by showing:
   - Caching
   - Task orchestration
   
Users should see tangible value immediately before moving to the next section.

### Phase 2: Restructure Information Architecture

Comprehensive restructuring of the entire getting started section:
- Implement progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Create technology-specific paths based on user's chosen framework/language
- Guide users through features relevant to their specific needs

### Phase 3: Interactive Enhancements

*Note: This phase is more exploratory*

- Add interactive demos on top of static content
- Create specific landing pages for each technology stack
- Develop advanced migration guides for scenarios where `nx init` isn't sufficient

## Success Metrics

The goal is to reduce time-to-value for new users while maintaining the comprehensive documentation that existing users rely on through progressive disclosure.
