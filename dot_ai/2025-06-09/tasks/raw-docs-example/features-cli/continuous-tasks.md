# Continuous Tasks

## Metadata

**Status**: draft

**Category**: CLI  

## Overview

Continuous Tasks is a proposed system for running long-running development tasks that persist across multiple development sessions. Unlike traditional one-shot tasks, continuous tasks remain active in the background, providing real-time feedback and automatic execution based on file changes.

## Problem Statement

Current development workflows require developers to manually restart tasks like test watchers, development servers, and linters after switching branches, pulling changes, or restarting their development environment. This leads to:

- Lost development time waiting for tasks to restart
- Inconsistent development environments across team members  
- Manual coordination of multiple long-running processes
- Difficulty maintaining complex task dependencies

Developers need a way to define persistent development tasks that:
- Automatically restart when needed
- Maintain state across development sessions
- Coordinate with other related tasks
- Provide consistent experiences across the team

## Solution

Continuous Tasks would provide a system for defining, managing, and coordinating long-running development processes through:

1. **Task Persistence**: Tasks that survive development session interruptions
2. **Smart Restart Logic**: Intelligent detection of when tasks need to restart
3. **Dependency Coordination**: Automatic management of task inter-dependencies  
4. **State Management**: Preservation of task state and configuration
5. **Team Synchronization**: Consistent task definitions across team members

## Implementation Details

### Proposed Architecture

*Note: This is early-stage design and subject to change*

```typescript
// Conceptual API design
interface ContinuousTask {
  name: string;
  command: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  restartTriggers: RestartTrigger[];
  persistState: boolean;
  healthCheck?: HealthCheckConfig;
}

interface RestartTrigger {
  type: 'file-change' | 'dependency-change' | 'branch-switch' | 'manual';
  pattern?: string;
  debounceMs?: number;
}
```

### Key Components (Planned)

1. **Task Registry**: Central registry of continuous task definitions
2. **Process Manager**: Daemon for managing long-running processes
3. **State Store**: Persistent storage for task state and configuration
4. **File Watcher**: Intelligent file system monitoring for restart triggers
5. **Health Monitor**: Automatic detection and recovery of failed tasks

### Configuration Approach (Draft)

```json
// nx.json (proposed)
{
  "continuousTasks": {
    "dev-server": {
      "command": "nx serve my-app",
      "dependencies": [],
      "restartOn": ["package.json", "nx.json"],
      "healthCheck": {
        "url": "http://localhost:4200/health",
        "intervalMs": 30000
      }
    },
    "test-watcher": {
      "command": "nx test my-app --watch",
      "dependencies": ["dev-server"],
      "restartOn": ["**/*.spec.ts", "jest.config.js"],
      "debounceMs": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

*Configuration is still being designed. The following represents current thinking:*

### Basic Setup (Proposed)

```bash
# Define a continuous task
nx continuous-task add dev-server --command="nx serve my-app" --persist

# Start continuous task management
nx continuous-task start

# View running tasks
nx continuous-task status
```

### Advanced Configuration (Conceptual)

```yaml
# .nx/continuous-tasks.yml (proposed format)
tasks:
  - name: "api-server"
    command: "nx serve api"
    restart_on:
      - "apps/api/**/*.ts"
      - "libs/shared/**/*.ts"
    depends_on: ["database"]
    
  - name: "frontend"
    command: "nx serve web"
    restart_on:
      - "apps/web/**/*"
    depends_on: ["api-server"]
    
  - name: "database"
    command: "docker-compose up postgres"
    restart_on:
      - "docker-compose.yml"
    persistent: true
```

## Examples

*These examples represent the intended developer experience:*

### Basic Workflow (Target Experience)

```bash
# Set up continuous tasks for the first time
nx continuous-task init

# Start your development environment
nx continuous-task start-all

# Tasks now run continuously, restarting automatically
# when relevant files change

# Check what's running
nx continuous-task status
# Output:
# ‚úÖ api-server    (running, port 3000)
# ‚úÖ frontend      (running, port 4200)  
# ‚úÖ test-watcher  (running, 45 tests passing)

# Stop everything when done
nx continuous-task stop-all
```

### Team Synchronization (Vision)

```bash
# Team member clones repo and runs:
nx continuous-task sync

# Automatically starts the same tasks as other team members
# based on shared configuration
```

## Design Status

### Current Phase: Requirements Gathering

- ‚úÖ Initial problem definition
- ‚úÖ High-level solution approach
- üöß Technical architecture design
- ‚è≥ API design and contracts
- ‚è≥ Implementation planning

### Open Questions

1. **Process Management**: How to handle task processes across different operating systems?
2. **State Persistence**: What task state needs to survive restarts and how to store it?
3. **Resource Management**: How to prevent runaway processes and manage system resources?
4. **Security**: How to safely execute user-defined commands in a persistent context?
5. **Team Coordination**: How to handle conflicts in task definitions across team members?

### Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from developer community
2. Create detailed technical specification
3. Build proof-of-concept implementation
4. Test with real-world development workflows
5. Iterate on design based on feedback

### Risks and Considerations

- **Complexity**: Managing persistent processes adds significant complexity
- **Platform Differences**: Different behavior across operating systems
- **Resource Usage**: Long-running processes can consume system resources
- **Debugging**: Harder to debug issues with persistent background tasks
- **Adoption**: Developers may prefer existing tools and workflows
