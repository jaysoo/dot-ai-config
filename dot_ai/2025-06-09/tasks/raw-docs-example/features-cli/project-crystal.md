# Project Crystal

## Metadata

**Status**: in-progress  
**Developers**: @vsavkin, @FrozenPandaz, @AgentMarine  
**Created**: 2024-01-10  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-09  
**Category**: CLI  

## Overview

Project Crystal is an advanced project graph analysis and optimization system that provides deep insights into workspace structure, dependencies, and potential improvements. It helps developers understand complex monorepo relationships and optimize their workspace architecture.

## Problem Statement

Large monorepos often develop complex dependency structures that become difficult to understand and maintain over time. Developers struggle with:

- Understanding implicit dependencies and coupling between projects
- Identifying circular dependencies and architectural issues
- Optimizing build and test performance based on project relationships
- Making informed decisions about project restructuring and modularization

Traditional project graph tools provide basic visualization but lack the analytical depth needed for optimization decisions. Teams need actionable insights about their workspace architecture to maintain velocity as the codebase grows.

## Solution

Project Crystal provides advanced analysis capabilities including:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Deep inspection of project relationships and coupling patterns
2. **Performance Insights**: Identification of bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. **Architecture Recommendations**: Suggested improvements based on best practices
4. **Impact Analysis**: Understanding the effect of changes across the workspace
5. **Health Scoring**: Quantitative metrics for workspace and project health

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Graph Analyzer**: 
   - Analyzes project dependency structures
   - Identifies patterns and anti-patterns
   - Calculates coupling and cohesion metrics

2. **Performance Profiler**:
   - Tracks task execution patterns
   - Identifies performance bottlenecks
   - Suggests optimization strategies

3. **Architecture Advisor**:
   - Applies architectural best practices
   - Suggests refactoring opportunities
   - Provides modularity recommendations

### Current Progress

- ✅ Basic dependency analysis
- ✅ Graph visualization improvements
- 🚧 Performance bottleneck detection (in development)
- ⏳ Architecture recommendations (planned)
- ⏳ Health scoring system (planned)

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Core analysis engine (work in progress)
interface ProjectAnalysis {
  dependencies: DependencyAnalysis;
  performance: PerformanceAnalysis;
  architecture: ArchitectureAnalysis;
  health: HealthMetrics;
}

interface DependencyAnalysis {
  coupling: CouplingMetrics;
  cycles: CircularDependency[];
  critical_path: string[];
  fan_in_out: FanMetrics;
}
```

## Configuration

### Basic Analysis

```json
// nx.json
{
  "crystal": {
    "enabled": true,
    "analysis": {
      "dependencies": true,
      "performance": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration (Planned)

```json
// nx.json
{
  "crystal": {
    "enabled": true,
    "analysis": {
      "dependencies": true,
      "performance": true,
      "architecture": true,
      "health": true
    },
    "thresholds": {
      "maxCoupling": 0.8,
      "maxCycleLength": 5,
      "minCohesion": 0.6
    },
    "recommendations": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoApply": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Current Functionality

```bash
# Run dependency analysis
nx graph --crystal-analysis

# Generate project insights (basic)
nx crystal analyze

# View coupling metrics
nx crystal metrics --type=coupling
```

### Planned Features

```bash
# Full analysis suite (coming soon)
nx crystal analyze --full

# Get architecture recommendations
nx crystal recommend --focus=modularity

# Health dashboard
nx crystal health --project=my-app

# Performance optimization suggestions
nx crystal optimize --target=build-time
```
