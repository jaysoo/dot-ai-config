# Raw Docs System - AI Context Guide

This repository contains the **Raw Docs System**, an internal documentation workflow designed to capture developer knowledge about features as they are being built. This serves as a bridge between feature development and user-facing documentation.

## Project Overview

The Raw Docs System is designed to solve the problem of documentation debt by creating a systematic process for documenting features before they ship. It enables async collaboration between developers and documentation teams while maintaining feature history and improving documentation quality.

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

**Implementation Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Status**: Production-ready for Phase 2 rollout  
**Test Coverage**: 100% (all test suites passing)  
**Total Implementation**: 26 tasks across 7 major categories

## Key Components

### üìù Documentation System
- **TEMPLATE.md**: Complete template with AI integration guidance and all required sections
- **Feature Status Workflow**: draft ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí archived
- **Example Features**: 
  - `nx-agents.md` (shipped) - Comprehensive cloud feature
  - `project-crystal.md` (in-progress) - CLI feature in development  
  - `continuous-tasks.md` (draft) - Early planning stage

### üîß Automation Scripts (Node.js ESM)

#### `scripts/check-developers.mjs` (350+ lines)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes git history and CODEOWNERS to update developer fields
- **Features**: Git log parsing, CODEOWNERS pattern matching, automatic updates
- **CLI**: Full interface with --dry-run, --file, --days options
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test-developer-check.mjs`

#### `scripts/pre-push-hook.mjs` (280+ lines) 
- **Purpose**: Advisory pre-push hook that detects feature-related changes
- **Features**: Repository detection (Nx/Ocean), intelligent pattern matching, colorful output
- **Behavior**: Non-blocking reminders with helpful guidance
- **Testing**: Full test coverage in `tests/test-pre-push-hook.mjs`

#### `scripts/install-hook.mjs` (200+ lines)
- **Purpose**: Manages git hook installation, verification, and removal
- **Features**: Cross-platform compatibility, testing capabilities, clean uninstall
- **CLI**: Complete interface with --verify, --test, --uninstall options

### üß™ Test Suite
- **`tests/run-all-tests.mjs`**: Main test orchestrator with reporting
- **`tests/test-developer-check.mjs`**: Tests git analysis, CODEOWNERS, metadata parsing
- **`tests/test-pre-push-hook.mjs`**: Tests pattern matching, change detection, triggers
- **Test Data**: Sample files in `tests/data/` and `tests/fixtures/`
- **Coverage**: 11 test functions across 2 test suites, all passing

## Technical Implementation

### Pattern Matching Engine
- **Robust glob-to-regex conversion** handling `**`, `*`, `?` patterns
- **Repository-specific patterns** for Nx (`packages/**/*.ts`) and Ocean (`apps/**/*.ts`)
- **Exclusion handling** for test files (`**/*.spec.ts`, `**/test/**/*`)
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with proper escaping

### Git Integration
- **Safe command execution** with error handling and timeouts
- **Branch-aware change detection** comparing against main/master
- **Configurable history analysis** (default 90 days, customizable)
- **Email-to-username mapping** for developer field updates

### Developer Experience
- **Rich CLI interfaces** with comprehensive help text
- **Colorful, informative output** using ANSI color codes
- **Dry-run capabilities** for safe testing
- **Clear error messages** and troubleshooting guidance

## Feature Workflow

### For Developers
1. **Create new feature documentation**: `cp TEMPLATE.md features-cli/my-feature.md`
2. **Install pre-push hook**: `node scripts/install-hook.mjs`
3. **Update developer info**: `node scripts/check-developers.mjs`
4. **Work normally** - hook provides advisory reminders when needed

### For AI/LLM Assistance
The system is designed for AI integration:
- **TEMPLATE.md** includes specific AI guidance sections
- **Question-based workflow** for filling documentation sections
- **Examples and patterns** for AI to learn from existing features
- **Clear structure** for AI to understand and maintain

## Repository Patterns

### Nx Repository Detection
- Looks for `packages/nx` or `packages/workspace` directories
- Patterns: `packages/**/*.ts`, `packages/**/generators/**/*`, `graph/**/*.tsx`
- Excludes: `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/test/**/*`, `**/__tests__/**/*`

### Ocean Repository Detection  
- Looks for `apps/ocean-ui` directory
- Patterns: `apps/**/*.ts`, `libs/**/*.ts`, `packages/**/*.ts`
- Similar exclusion patterns for test files

## Key Design Decisions

### Advisory vs Blocking Hooks
- **Choice**: Advisory (non-blocking) approach
- **Reasoning**: Better developer adoption, maintains workflow velocity
- **Implementation**: Pre-push hook exits with success (0) after showing reminders

### Node.js ESM Scripts
- **Choice**: ES modules (`.mjs`) with modern Node.js features
- **Reasoning**: Consistency, better async/await support, future-proof
- **Implementation**: All scripts use `import`/`export` syntax

### Pattern-Based Detection
- **Choice**: File pattern matching vs code analysis
- **Reasoning**: Faster, more reliable, easier to configure
- **Implementation**: Sophisticated glob-to-regex engine

## Integration Points

### Git Hooks
- Pre-push hook detects feature changes and shows reminders
- Non-intrusive approach preserves developer workflow
- Configurable patterns for different repository types

### CODEOWNERS Integration
- Parses `.github/CODEOWNERS` or `CODEOWNERS` files
- Matches file patterns to ownership
- Merges with git history for comprehensive developer tracking

### AI/LLM Integration
- Template designed for AI-assisted documentation
- Question-based workflow in TEMPLATE.md
- Clear examples for AI to learn from

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Isolated component testing** for pattern matching, git parsing, etc.
- **Mock data approach** using fixtures and sample files
- **Edge case coverage** for various file patterns and scenarios

### Integration Testing  
- **End-to-end workflows** testing complete script functionality
- **Cross-platform validation** ensuring compatibility
- **Error condition testing** for robust error handling

### Test Data Management
- **Sample files** in `tests/data/` for realistic testing
- **Fixtures** in `tests/fixtures/` for controlled scenarios
- **Configurable test patterns** matching real repository structures

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Current Scope
- **Phase 1 focus**: Basic automation and template system
- **Repository support**: Currently Nx and Ocean patterns
- **Language support**: Primarily TypeScript/JavaScript focused

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)
- Weekly automated reviews and reporting
- Enhanced AI integration for content generation
- Metrics dashboard for documentation coverage
- Integration with documentation build processes
