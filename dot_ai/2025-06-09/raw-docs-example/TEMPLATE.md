### Using AI to Create Documentation

When documenting a new feature with AI assistance, follow this question-based approach:

1. **Feature Overview**: Ask AI to help identify the core purpose and value proposition
   - "What problem does this feature solve?"
   - "Who is the target user for this feature?"
   - "What are the key benefits?"

2. **Technical Details**: Use AI to help structure technical explanations
   - "How should I explain the architecture of this feature?"
   - "What implementation details are most important for users?"
   - "Are there any technical constraints I should document?"

3. **Usage Examples**: Get AI help creating practical examples
   - "What are the most common use cases for this feature?"
   - "Can you help create code examples for basic usage?"
   - "What edge cases should I document?"

4. **Related Features**: Have AI help identify connections
   - "What other features does this relate to?"
   - "Are there any dependencies I should mention?"
   - "What features might conflict with this?"

### AI Best Practices

- **Provide Context**: Give AI access to code, issues, and existing documentation
- **Iterate and Refine**: Use AI suggestions as a starting point, then refine based on your expertise
- **Verify Accuracy**: Always review AI-generated content for technical accuracy
- **Maintain Voice**: Ensure the final documentation matches your project's tone and style
- **Update Regularly**: Use AI to help keep documentation current as features evolve

### Questions to Ask AI

Copy these prompts to get started with AI-assisted documentation:

```
"Help me document this feature: [feature name]. Here's the code/issue/context: [paste relevant information]. What should I include in each section of the template?"

"Review this feature documentation for completeness and accuracy: [paste your draft]. What's missing or unclear?"

"How can I better explain this technical concept to users: [paste technical details]?"

"What examples would be most helpful for users of this feature: [describe feature]?"
```
