# Summary - June 9, 2025

## Accomplishments

### Organizational Improvements
- **Reorganized dot_ai folder structure** (Completed): Successfully restructured all yyyy-mm-dd folders to have consistent subdirectories (tasks/, specs/, dictations/). Moved 86 files to their appropriate locations while preserving SUMMARY.md files at root level. This improves discoverability and organization of past work.

### MCP Server Enhancements
- **Enhanced Search Engine with Date Ranges and Categories** (Completed): Implemented comprehensive improvements to MCP AI content server's search engine:
  - Added date range filtering with inclusive start..end syntax (e.g., 2025-01-01..2025-01-31)
  - Implemented flexible category matching for singular/plural forms (spec/specs, task/tasks, dictation/dictations)
  - Changed category detection from filename-based to folder-based with backward compatibility
  - Added comprehensive tests and updated documentation

- **Improved MCP Server Discoverability** (Completed): Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to make MyNotes MCP server more discoverable by AI tools:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with MCP priority instructions
  - Created detailed instructions for Claude and Cursor integration
  - Implemented keyword mapping system with 71.4% accuracy
  - Developed usage examples and integration guide
  - Built monitoring system to track MCP usage and identify optimization opportunities

### Raw Docs System
- **Specified Raw Docs System**: Created detailed specification for internal documentation workflow to capture developer knowledge during feature development. System bridges gap between feature development and user-facing documentation.
- **Phase 1 Implementation** (In Progress): Created working example of raw-docs repository with essential scripts, templates, and pre-push hooks for tracking feature documentation. Successfully completed Tasks 1-7 with all 28 subtasks, including:
  - Basic repository structure with proper folder organization
  - Complete feature documentation template with AI integration instructions
  - Example feature documentation (nx-agents.md, project-crystal.md, continuous-tasks.md)
  - Developer check script with git history analysis
  - Pre-push hook script with installation utility
  - Comprehensive documentation and contributing guidelines
  - Full integration test suite
