# Summary - June 9, 2025

## Accomplishments

### Organizational Improvements
- **Reorganized dot_ai folder structure**: Successfully restructured all yyyy-mm-dd folders to have consistent subdirectories (tasks/, specs/, dictations/). Moved 86 files to their appropriate locations while preserving SUMMARY.md files at root level. This improves discoverability and organization of past work.

### MCP Server Enhancement
- **Improved MCP Server Discoverability**: Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to make MyNotes MCP server more discoverable by AI tools:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with MCP priority instructions
  - Created detailed instructions for Claude and Cursor integration
  - Implemented keyword mapping system with 71.4% accuracy
  - Developed usage examples and integration guide
  - Built monitoring system to track MCP usage and identify optimization opportunities

### Raw Docs System
- **Specified Raw Docs System**: Created detailed specification for internal documentation workflow to capture developer knowledge during feature development. System bridges gap between feature development and user-facing documentation.
- **Phase 1 Implementation Started**: Created working example of raw-docs repository with essential scripts, templates, and pre-push hooks for tracking feature documentation.

### MCP Search Engine Enhancements
- **Enhanced Search Engine with Date Ranges and Categories**: Implemented comprehensive improvements to MCP AI content server's search engine:
  - Added date range filtering with inclusive start..end syntax (e.g., 2025-01-01..2025-01-31)
  - Implemented flexible category matching for singular/plural forms (spec/specs, task/tasks, dictation/dictations)
  - Changed category detection from filename-based to folder-based with backward compatibility
  - Added comprehensive tests and updated documentation
