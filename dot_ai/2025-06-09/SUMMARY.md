# Summary - June 9, 2025

## Accomplishments

### Organizational Improvements
- **Reorganized dot_ai folder structure**: Successfully restructured all yyyy-mm-dd folders to have consistent subdirectories (tasks/, specs/, dictations/). Moved 86 files to their appropriate locations while preserving SUMMARY.md files at root level. This improves discoverability and organization of past work.

### MCP Server Enhancement
- **Improved MCP Server Discoverability**: Created comprehensive plan to make MyNotes MCP server more discoverable by AI tools. Defined keyword mappings, usage patterns, and integration strategies to ensure AI prioritizes MCP server for notes, dictations, specs, and TODOs queries.

### Raw Docs System
- **Specified Raw Docs System**: Created detailed specification for internal documentation workflow to capture developer knowledge during feature development. System bridges gap between feature development and user-facing documentation.
- **Phase 1 Implementation Started**: Created working example of raw-docs repository with essential scripts, templates, and pre-push hooks for tracking feature documentation.

### MCP Search Engine Enhancements
- **Enhanced Search Engine with Date Ranges and Categories**: Implemented comprehensive improvements to MCP AI content server's search engine:
  - Added date range filtering with inclusive start..end syntax (e.g., 2025-01-01..2025-01-31)
  - Implemented flexible category matching for singular/plural forms (spec/specs, task/tasks, dictation/dictations)
  - Changed category detection from filename-based to folder-based with backward compatibility
  - Added comprehensive tests and updated documentation
