# Summary for 2025-06-18

## Overview

Today was a highly productive day focused on enhancing the raw-docs tools, particularly the `analyze-changes.mjs` script. Major improvements were made to the script's functionality including author filtering, commit comparison flexibility, and automatic SHA tracking. Additionally, comprehensive documentation improvements were completed across the Nx documentation suite, and several configuration simplifications were implemented to improve the developer experience.
