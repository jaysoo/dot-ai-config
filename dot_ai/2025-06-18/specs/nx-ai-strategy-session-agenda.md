# Nx AI Strategy Session Agenda Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines a comprehensive two-day AI strategy session for the Nx platform team to align on MCP and AI integrations, establishing Nx as an "AI-first" development platform.

## Context
- Nx has recently updated its tagline to mention "AI-first"
- Current state includes separate MCP packages that need integration
- Need to align on tools to support and user experience to provide
- Focus areas: Nx CLI, Nx Cloud, Nx Console

## Current AI Capabilities
- **MCP Implementation**: Currently shipped as separate package, needs integration as `nx mcp`
- **Nx Cloud MCP**: Handles multi-repo management and CI (separate from CLI)
- **Documentation AI Chat**: Exists but not strategic focus
- **Rules Management**: Discussed for tools like Cursor and Claude

## Key User Scenarios

### Priority Workflows (in order)
1. **Fix broken builds affecting multiple projects**
   - Context needed: Project dependency graph, recent changes, affected projects, consumer relationships
   
2. **Generate new library with proper setup**
   - Context needed: Workspace conventions, existing patterns, dependencies, testing setup
   
3. **Migrate workspace to new Nx version**
   - Context needed: Version gaps, breaking changes, custom plugins/executors, migration patterns
   
4. **Optimize slow CI builds**
   - Context needed: Task execution times, cache hit rates, parallelization opportunities

5. **Local error fixing with verification**
   - Context needed: Error context, fix verification steps, affected project tests/builds

## Documentation Strategy

### AI-Friendly Documentation Requirements
- Structured examples with full context (100% priority)
- File paths, prerequisites, and outputs clearly shown
- Command patterns and troubleshooting handled by MCP

### Example Format
```markdown
### Generate Library
**Workspace Structure Before**:
apps/
  myapp/
libs/
  (empty)

**Command**: nx g @nx/js:lib data-access
**Modified Files**:
- workspace.json (or nx.json)
- libs/data-access/project.json (created)
- libs/data-access/src/index.ts (created)
- tsconfig.base.json (updated paths)

**Workspace Structure After**:
apps/
  myapp/
libs/
  data-access/
    src/
      index.ts
    project.json
```

### Documentation Must Include
- Examples matching common user AI prompts
- Verification steps for each command
- Full context showing before/after states

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### MCP Strategy
- Barebones entry: `npx nx@latest mcp` with no config required
- Progressive enhancement: `nx init` unlocks more features
- `nx add @nx/ai` for generators, sync, inference plugin

### Verification Intelligence
- After TypeScript errors: Run typecheck/build/test for project
- After API changes: Run consumer tests, especially frontend e2e
- Cross-repo verification via Nx Cloud MCP
- Local/pre-commit same approach, CI verifies everything

## Two-Day Session Agenda

### Day 1: Foundation & Current State

**Morning: Where We Are**
- AI landscape audit: Current MCPs, integrations, adoption metrics
- User research findings: Compiled AI prompts, support tickets analysis
- Competitive analysis: How other tools approach AI
- Demo current capabilities and gaps

**Afternoon: Technical Deep Dive**
- MCP architecture review and improvements
- Documentation AI-readiness assessment
- Verification/validation strategy for AI-generated code
- Local vs Cloud intelligence boundaries

### Day 2: Vision & Execution

**Morning: Partnerships & Ecosystem**
- **Anthropic collaboration ideas:**
  - Nx-optimized Claude model/mode
  - Exclusive MCP capabilities
  - Co-developed templates/workflows
  - Joint go-to-market strategies
- **Other partnerships:**
  - Netlify deployment intelligence
  - GitHub/GitLab integration
  - IDE vendors (JetBrains, VS Code)
  - Cloud providers (AWS, GCP)
- **Open source contributions**

**Afternoon: Roadmap & Action**
- Feature prioritization matrix
- MVP definition and timeline
- Success metrics (adoption, satisfaction, efficiency gains)
- Resource allocation and team structure
- Communication strategy

## Key Deliverables

1. **90-day AI feature roadmap**
   - Prioritized list of AI features to build
   - Technical implementation plan
   - Resource requirements

2. **Partnership outreach plan**
   - Short list of target partners
   - Value propositions for each
   - Initial contact strategy

3. **Documentation transformation timeline**
   - Phases for updating documentation
   - Automation strategy for maintaining accuracy
   - Success metrics for AI parseability

4. **Technical architecture decisions**
   - MCP integration approach
   - Local vs cloud boundaries
   - Security and privacy considerations

5. **Budget and resource requirements**
   - Team structure needs
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Training requirements

## Success Metrics

- AI tool adoption rate among Nx users
- Reduction in support tickets for common tasks
- Developer productivity improvements
- Time to complete common workflows
- Documentation effectiveness for AI agents

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. How to compile and verify actual user AI prompts systematically?
2. What level of AI model customization is needed (fine-tuning vs prompting)?
3. How to balance ease of use with power user features?
4. What security/privacy guardrails are needed for workspace data?
5. How to measure ROI of AI investments?

## Notes

- Strategic partnerships remain open for discussion
- Concrete decisions will be made during the session
- Focus on making documentation immediately AI-parseable
- Ensure baseline MCP experience is compelling without configuration
