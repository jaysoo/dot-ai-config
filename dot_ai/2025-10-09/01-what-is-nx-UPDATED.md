# What is Nx?

Nx is a powerful, open source, technology-agnostic build platform designed to efficiently manage codebases of any scale. From small single projects to large enterprise monorepos, Nx provides the platform to **efficiently get from starting a feature in your editor to a green PR**.

As teams and codebases grow, productivity bottlenecks multiply: build times increase, CI becomes flaky, and code sharing becomes complex. **Nx reduces friction across your entire development cycle.**

## Key Features

- **Smart Build System**: Nx intelligently manages tasks across your codebase, running them efficiently and in the correct order
- **Computation Caching**: Avoid rebuilding the same code twice with sophisticated caching that remembers previous task results
- **Affected Commands**: Run tasks only on projects that are actually impacted by your code changes
- **Technology Agnostic**: Works with any technology stack or framework
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle everything from small single projects to large enterprise monorepos
