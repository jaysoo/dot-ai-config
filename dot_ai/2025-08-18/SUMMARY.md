# Daily Summary - August 18, 2025

## Tasks Completed

### GitHub Stats Collection Script Enhancement
- **Status**: Completed
- **Time**: 2025-08-18 (current session)
- **Description**: Enhanced the `collect-monthly-stats.mjs` script to handle current month updates properly
- **Key Changes**:
  - Modified script to always update the current month's data (no longer skips if file exists)
  - Added `lastUpdated` timestamp to all JSON data files for tracking when data was last collected
  - Implemented logic to update previous months if their last update was before the month ended
  - Example: If July 2025 was last updated on 2025-07-29, it will now update to capture the missing July 30-31 data
- **Impact**: Ensures complete and up-to-date GitHub contribution statistics for the Nx team

## Technical Improvements

- **Data Integrity**: The script now prevents data gaps that could occur when:
  - Current month data becomes stale
  - Previous months were collected before month end
- **Tracking**: Added ISO timestamp (`lastUpdated`) to enable audit trail of when each month's data was collected

## Files Modified

- `/Users/jack/projects/collect-github-stats/collect-monthly-stats.mjs`
  - Lines 134-180: Added smart update detection logic
  - Line 202: Added `lastUpdated` timestamp to JSON output

## Next Steps

- Monitor the script execution to ensure current month (2025-08) updates properly
- Verify that any incomplete previous months get re-collected automatically
