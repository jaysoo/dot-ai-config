## Technical Details

### Tailwind v4 Key Decisions
1. **No config files for v4 + Vite**: Clean setup without PostCSS/Tailwind configs
2. **Automatic dependency detection**: v4 + Vite handles styles from dependencies automatically
3. **CSS import syntax**: v4 uses `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of `@tailwind` directives

### Test Scripts Created
- Multiple debugging scripts for workspace creation issues
- Fixed React generator dependency conflicts
- Resolved Laravel plugin test mock issues

## Next Steps
1. **Tailwind v4**: Documentation updates and migration guide
2. **Laravel Plugin**: Real-world testing and community feedback
3. **Easy Issues**: Prioritize and assign to team/AI
4. **Visual Affordances**: Explore implementation with Nx Cloud MCP

## Notes
- Tailwind v4 implementation was smoother than expected due to its simplified configuration model
- Laravel plugin follows established patterns, making it maintainable
- The easy issues analysis provides a clear path for community contributions
- This addresses long-standing user requests for both Tailwind v4 and Laravel support in Nx
