## Tasks Completed

### Tailwind v4 Implementation
- **Status**: âœ… Completed (Moved from pending to completed in TODO.md)
- **Files**:
  - Task plan: `tasks/tailwind-v4-implementation.md`
  - Linear ticket: NXC-2084
- **Summary**: Successfully implemented Tailwind CSS v4 support for React and Vue generators
- **Key achievements**:
  - Added version detection for Tailwind v2, v3, and v4
  - Added bundler detection (Vite, Webpack, Rspack, Rsbuild)
  - Implemented conditional logic for v4 + Vite to use `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
  - Maintained full backward compatibility with v3
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
  - Successfully passed all validation tests
- **Technical implementation**:
  - Created 10+ new utility files for version/bundler detection
  - Modified both React and Vue setup-tailwind generators
  - Added 100+ unit tests and E2E tests
  - All code formatted with prettier and passing prepush validation

## Key Decisions

1. **No config files for v4 + Vite**: When using Tailwind v4 with Vite, no PostCSS or Tailwind config files are generated
2. **Automatic dependency detection**: v4 + Vite automatically detects and includes styles from dependencies without needing `createGlobPatternsForDependencies`
3. **CSS import syntax change**: v4 uses `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of `@tailwind` directives

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation updates**: Update React and Vue Tailwind documentation to explain v4 support
2. **Migration guide**: Create a guide for migrating from Tailwind v3 to v4
3. **Angular support**: Wait for Angular CLI updates before implementing v4 support for Angular

## Implementation Details

- **Branch**: `feat/tailwind-4` (ready for review)
- **Commits**: Multiple small, focused commits following the implementation plan
- **Testing**: All unit tests and E2E tests passing
- **Validation**: Passed `nx prepush` after fixing commit message format

## Notes

- The implementation was smoother than expected - v4's simplified configuration model works well with Nx
- The `createGlobPatternsForDependencies` utility continues to work correctly with v4 when using non-Vite bundlers
- All tests pass and the code is ready for review
- This addresses a long-standing user request for Tailwind v4 support in Nx
