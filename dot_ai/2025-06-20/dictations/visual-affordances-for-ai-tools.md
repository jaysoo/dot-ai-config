# Visual Affordances for AI Tools

## Overview

It would be valuable to integrate visual feedback mechanisms when AI tools perform tasks, particularly for development workflows. This could leverage Nx Cloud MCP or Nx itself, potentially integrating with tools like Playwright, to provide visual confirmation of AI-executed tasks.

## Current Challenge

When using AI tools like Claude Code to implement features (such as the `@nx/php/laravel` plugin), the AI can:
- Run tests
- Verify the created workspace functions correctly
- Execute various commands

However, there's no visual feedback to quickly verify the results without manually diving into the code.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a system that provides visual artifacts such as:
- Videos of the execution process
- Series of screenshots showing:
  - Terminal output
  - Application state
  - File structure changes
  - Test results

## Benefits

1. **Quick Visual Verification**: Users can glance at screenshots/videos to immediately identify if something looks wrong
2. **Reduced Context Switching**: No need to jump into code and manually test everything
3. **Better Documentation**: Visual artifacts serve as documentation of what was implemented
4. **Faster Feedback Loop**: Issues can be spotted visually before diving into code

## Implementation Ideas

- Integrate with Playwright for automated screenshot capture
- Use Nx Cloud to store and display visual artifacts
- Create an MCP server that captures terminal output and application state
- Generate a visual report after AI task completion

## Use Case Example

When implementing the `@nx/php/laravel` plugin:
1. AI runs the implementation
2. System captures screenshots of:
   - Test execution in terminal
   - Generated file structure
   - Laravel app running with the new plugin
   - Nx graph showing the new targets
3. User receives a visual summary to quickly verify everything looks correct

**Clarifications Needed:**
- "PlayWriter" was mentioned - this likely refers to Playwright (the browser automation tool)
- ".phd.larvel" was mentioned - this likely refers to the `@nx/php/laravel` plugin being implemented
