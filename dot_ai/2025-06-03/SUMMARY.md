# 2025-06-03: URL Validation and Testing

## Timeline of Activities

### Morning (~9:00-10:00) - URL Extraction
- **Extracted URLs from sitemap** into `urls-to-check.txt`
- Prepared list of all documentation URLs for validation testing

### Mid-Morning (~10:00-12:00) - URL Health Check Development
- **Created URL checker script** (`check-sitemap-urls.js`) with:
  - Batch processing to avoid server overload
  - HEAD request method for efficiency
  - Timeout handling (10 second limit)
  - Progress tracking and reporting
  - Error collection and categorization

### Afternoon (~1:00-2:00) - Testing and Results
- **Executed batch URL testing** across all sitemap URLs
- **Generated failure report** (`failed_url.txt`) documenting:
  - HTTP status codes for failed requests
  - Network errors and timeouts
  - Specific error messages for debugging
- **Analyzed results**:
  - Categorized successful vs failed URLs
  - Identified patterns in failures
  - Created actionable report for fixing broken links

## Key Findings
- Systematic testing revealed which documentation URLs were accessible
- Failed URLs documented with specific error details for remediation
- Batch processing approach prevented server overload during testing

## Technologies Used
- Node.js with native fetch API
- Asynchronous batch processing
- HEAD requests for performance optimization
