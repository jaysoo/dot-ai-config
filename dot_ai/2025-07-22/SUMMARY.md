# Summary for 2025-07-22

## Tasks Completed

### Fix Astro Docs Markdown Error
- **Time**: 17:40 ET
- **Task Plan**: `.ai/2025-07-22/tasks/fix-astro-docs-markdown-error.md`
- **Problem**: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE] when building astro-docs after rebasing with master
- **Root Cause**: Starlight's markdown processors expect file paths for dynamically generated content
- **Solution**: Skip renderMarkdown calls in custom loaders (cli.loader.ts and devkit.loader.ts)
- **Result**: Build completes successfully without errors
- **Branch**: `jack/astro-docs-fix-entry-metadata` (commit: 41d3f314c4)

## Key Findings

1. **Astro/Starlight Processing Pipeline**:
   - Loaders should provide raw content to the content store
   - Starlight handles markdown rendering later in its pipeline
   - Pre-rendering with renderMarkdown was redundant and causing conflicts

2. **Migration Impact**:
   - The switch from tsconfig path aliases to pnpm-workspace.yaml was not the root cause
   - The error existed on the original branch too
   - The issue was with how dynamic content interacts with Starlight's transformers

3. **Solution Benefits**:
   - No functionality loss - all markdown features still work
   - Better performance without double rendering
   - Cleaner separation of concerns between loaders and Starlight

## Next Steps

1. Merge the fix from `jack/astro-docs-fix-entry-metadata` branch
2. Monitor for any rendering issues with the dynamic content
3. Consider documenting this pattern for future custom Astro loaders
