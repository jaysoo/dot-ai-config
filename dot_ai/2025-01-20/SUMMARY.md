# Summary for 2025-01-20

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Review Tailwind v4 support changes (15:00)
  - Reviewed feat/tailwind-4 branch changes against master
  - Verified createGlobPatternsForDependencies works correctly
  - Confirmed support for React and Vue across Vite, Webpack, Rspack, Rsbuild
  - Implementation is production-ready with smart version detection

## Key Findings

### Tailwind v4 Implementation
- Smart version and bundler detection
- Vite + v4: Uses @tailwindcss/vite plugin (no config files)
- Webpack/Rspack/Rsbuild + v4: Uses @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- Full backwards compatibility with v2/v3
- Comprehensive e2e test coverage

### createGlobPatternsForDependencies Status
- âœ… Works correctly with Tailwind v4
- Not needed for Vite (auto-scans dependencies)
- Used and tested for webpack-based bundlers
- Successfully includes workspace library styles

## Areas for Future Improvement
1. Documentation updates for v4 specifics
2. Edge case testing (dynamic imports, nested dependencies)
3. Error handling for version conflicts
4. Performance monitoring in large monorepos
5. Migration guide from v3 to v4
