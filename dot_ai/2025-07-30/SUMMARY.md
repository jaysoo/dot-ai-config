## Tasks Completed

### Address CRITICAL(AI) sections in Docker documentation
- **Time**: 14:30
- **Plan**: `.ai/2025-07-30/tasks/address-docker-docs-critical-sections.md`
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

**Summary**: Successfully addressed three CRITICAL(AI) sections in the Docker release documentation:
1. Enhanced the Production and Hotfix Releases section with comprehensive examples of customizing Docker version schemes
2. Added professional Nx Cloud Agents compatibility warnings in both `release-docker-images.md` and `publish-in-ci-cd.md`
3. Updated the nx-json reference documentation to include all available pattern tokens

**Key Changes**:
- `docs/shared/recipes/nx-release/release-docker-images.md`: Added version scheme customization examples and Nx Cloud warning
- `docs/shared/recipes/nx-release/publish-in-ci-cd.md`: Added consistent Nx Cloud warning
- `docs/shared/reference/nx-json.md`: Added missing `{projectName}` token and expanded date format documentation

**Impact**: Users now have clear documentation on how to customize Docker version schemes with all available patterns, and are properly informed about Nx Cloud Agents limitations with a helpful pointer to Nx Enterprise support.
