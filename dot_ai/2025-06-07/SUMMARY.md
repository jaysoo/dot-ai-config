# 2025-06-07: Nx Version List Storage

## Timeline of Activities

### Morning - Version Data Storage
- **Stored Nx 21.1 versions** (`nx_21_1_versions.txt`)
- This appears to be a continuation or refinement of the previous day's version extraction work
- File contains the list of Nx 21.1.x versions for reference

## Summary
This was a light day focused on storing the version data extracted on 2025-06-06. The single file appears to be the final output of the version extraction process, saved for future reference or use in the Debian packaging pipeline.

## Purpose
The stored version list likely serves as:
- Reference for which Nx versions need Debian packages
- Input for automated package building scripts
- Documentation of the 21.1.x release history

## Technologies Used
- Plain text storage for version tracking
