# Nx v22 Migration Test Results

Tests performed on 2025-10-17 using Nx v21.6.5 → v22.0.0-beta.6

## 1. JS Migration (@nx/js) ✅

**Migration**: `remove-external-options-from-js-executors`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/js-test`

**Setup**:
- Created workspace with `preset=ts`
- Generated library with `@nx/js:lib` using swc bundler
- Added deprecated options to both `project.json` and `nx.json`:
  - `external: ["rxjs", "lodash"]` (options and configurations.production)
  - `externalBuildTargets: ["build", "build-base"]` (options and configurations.production)
  - Same options in `nx.json` targetDefaults for `@nx/js:swc`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `external` and `externalBuildTargets` from `my-lib/project.json` options
- ✅ Successfully removed these options from `configurations.production`
- ✅ Successfully removed these options from `nx.json` targetDefaults
- ✅ Cleaned up empty `configurations.production` object
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `my-lib/project.json` - removed deprecated options
- `nx.json` - removed deprecated options from targetDefaults

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in js-test workspace

## 2. React Webpack Migration (@nx/react) ✅

**Migration**: `add-svgr-to-webpack-config`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/react-test`

**Setup**:
- Created workspace with `preset=react-monorepo`
- Generated React app with `bundler=webpack`
- Added deprecated option to `webpack.config.js`:
  - `new NxReactWebpackPlugin({ svgr: false })`
- Created explicit `project.json` with `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor (required for migration to detect the project)

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `svgr: false` option from `NxReactWebpackPlugin`
- ✅ Correctly left `NxReactWebpackPlugin()` without any options object
- ✅ Did NOT add `withSvgr()` wrapper (correct behavior since svgr was set to false)
- ✅ Added `file-loader@^6.2.0` as devDependency
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `my-webpack-app/webpack.config.js` - removed svgr option
- `package.json` - added file-loader

**Important Note**: Migration only works with explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor in `project.json`. Inferred webpack projects (using `@nx/webpack/plugin`) are not detected by this migration.

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in react-test workspace

## 3. Next.js Migration (@nx/next) ✅

**Migration**: `add-svgr-to-next-config`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/next-test`

**Setup**:
- Created workspace with `preset=next`
- Added deprecated option to `next.config.js`:
  - `nx: { svgr: true }` in nextConfig
- Created explicit `project.json` with `@nx/next:build` executor (required for migration to detect the project)

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `svgr: true` option from `nx` object
- ✅ Left `nx: {}` empty object
- ✅ Added `withSvgr()` webpack config function with SVGR loader configuration
- ✅ Added `withSvgr` to `composePlugins()` call as the last argument
- ✅ Added `file-loader@^6.2.0` as devDependency
- ⚠️ Migration only processes `svgr: true` or `svgr: { options }` - correctly skips `svgr: false`

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/my-next-app/next.config.js` - removed nx.svgr option, added withSvgr function
- `package.json` - added file-loader

**Important Notes**:
- Migration only works with explicit `@nx/next:build` executor in `project.json`
- Migration only acts on `svgr: true` or object values, skips `svgr: false` (correct behavior)
- Inferred Next.js projects (using `@nx/next/plugin`) are not detected

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in next-test workspace

## Summary

**Completed**: 3/7 migrations tested
**Success Rate**: 100%
**Issues Found**: None

**Still To Test**:
- Webpack migration (deleteOutputPath, sassImplementation)
- Rspack migration (deleteOutputPath, sassImplementation)
- Nx release config migrations (2 migrations)

**Key Findings**:
1. JS migration works with both explicit project.json and inferred projects
2. React webpack migration requires explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor in project.json
3. Next.js migration requires explicit `@nx/next:build` executor in project.json
4. All migrations correctly handle cleanup of empty objects/properties
5. All migrations preserve other configuration options
6. Migrations that target specific deprecated options correctly skip projects that don't use those options
