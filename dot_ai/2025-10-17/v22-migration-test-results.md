# Nx v22 Migration Test Results

Tests performed on 2025-10-17 using Nx v21.6.5 → v22.0.0-beta.6

## Important Note About Testing

**Critical**: When testing webpack/Next.js/React webpack migrations, you MUST use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspaces and generating projects. Without this flag:
- Nx v21 uses the new plugin-based inference system
- Projects don't have explicit executors in project.json
- Migrations can't detect these projects (they look for explicit executors like `@nx/webpack:webpack`)

**Correct approach:**
```bash
NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false npx create-nx-workspace@21 ...
NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false npx nx g @nx/react:app ...
```

## 1. JS Migration (@nx/js) ✅

**Migration**: `remove-external-options-from-js-executors`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/js-test`

**Setup**:
- Created workspace with `preset=ts`
- Generated library with `@nx/js:lib` using swc bundler
- Added deprecated options to both `project.json` and `nx.json`:
  - `external: ["rxjs", "lodash"]` (options and configurations.production)
  - `externalBuildTargets: ["build", "build-base"]` (options and configurations.production)
  - Same options in `nx.json` targetDefaults for `@nx/js:swc`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `external` and `externalBuildTargets` from `my-lib/project.json` options
- ✅ Successfully removed these options from `configurations.production`
- ✅ Successfully removed these options from `nx.json` targetDefaults
- ✅ Cleaned up empty `configurations.production` object
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `my-lib/project.json` - removed deprecated options
- `nx.json` - removed deprecated options from targetDefaults

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in js-test workspace

## 2. React Webpack Migration (@nx/react) ✅

**Migration**: `add-svgr-to-webpack-config`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/react-test`

**Setup**:
- **Critical**: Used `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspace and generating app
- Created workspace: `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false npx create-nx-workspace@21 react-test --preset=react-monorepo`
- Generated React app: `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false npx nx g @nx/react:app my-webpack-app --bundler=webpack`
- This creates explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor in `package.json` (not project.json)
- Uncommented the deprecated option in generated `webpack.config.js`:
  - `withReact({ svgr: false })`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `svgr: false` option from `withReact()`
- ✅ Correctly left `withReact()` without any options object
- ✅ Did NOT add `withSvgr()` wrapper (correct behavior since svgr was set to false - SVGR disabled by default in v22)
- ✅ Added `file-loader@^6.2.0` as devDependency
- ✅ Build and lint verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `my-webpack-app/webpack.config.js` - removed svgr option
- `package.json` - added file-loader and upgraded to v22

**Important Note**: Migration requires explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor. Must use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating/generating projects, otherwise Nx v21 uses plugin inference and the migration won't detect the project.

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in react-test workspace

## 3. Next.js Migration (@nx/next) ✅

**Migration**: `add-svgr-to-next-config`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/next-test`

**Setup**:
- **Critical**: Used `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspace
- Created workspace: `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false npx create-nx-workspace@21 next-test --preset=next`
- This creates explicit `@nx/next:build` executor in `package.json`
- Added deprecated option to `next.config.js`:
  - `nx: { svgr: true }` in nextConfig

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed `svgr: true` option from `nx` object
- ✅ Left `nx: {}` empty object
- ✅ Added complete `withSvgr()` webpack config function with SVGR loader configuration
- ✅ Added `withSvgr` to `composePlugins()` call as the last argument
- ✅ Added `file-loader@^6.2.0` as devDependency
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration
- ⚠️ Migration only processes `svgr: true` or `svgr: { options }` - correctly skips `svgr: false`

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/my-next-app/next.config.js` - removed nx.svgr option, added withSvgr function
- `package.json` - added file-loader and upgraded to v22

**Important Notes**:
- Migration requires explicit `@nx/next:build` executor. Must use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspaces, otherwise Nx v21 uses plugin inference and the migration won't detect the project
- Migration only acts on `svgr: true` or object values, correctly skips `svgr: false`

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in next-test workspace

## 4. Webpack Migration (@nx/webpack) ✅

**Migration**: `remove-deprecated-options`

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/webpack-test`

**Setup**:
- Created workspace with `preset=ts`
- Installed @nx/webpack@21.6.5
- Created library with explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor
- Added deprecated options to project.json:
  - `deleteOutputPath: true`
  - `sassImplementation: "sass"`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed both deprecated options from project.json
- ✅ Migration logged console messages explaining the removals
- ✅ Cleaned up options object

**Files Changed**:
- `my-webpack-lib/project.json` - removed deprecated options

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in webpack-test workspace

  - `deleteOutputPath: true`
  - `sassImplementation: "sass"`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully removed both deprecated options from project.json
- ✅ Also added `root` property to project.json (normalization)

**Files Changed**:
- `my-rspack-lib/project.json` - removed deprecated options

**Git Branch**: `v22-migration` in rspack-test workspace

**Setup**:
- Added `release.version.generatorOptions` to nx.json with all supported properties:
  - `specifierSource: "prompt"`
  - `currentVersionResolver: "registry"`
  - `currentVersionResolverMetadata: { "tag": "latest" }`
  - `fallbackCurrentVersionResolver: "disk"`
  - `versionPrefix: "auto"`
  - `updateDependents: "auto"`
  - `logUnchangedProjects: true`

- ✅ Removed `generatorOptions` wrapper completely
- ✅ Preserved all property values correctly
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `nx.json` - promoted generatorOptions properties to top-level

**Git Branch**: `test-release-version-migration` in js-test workspace

---

### Migration 2: `consolidate-release-tag-config` ✅

**Test Workspace**: `/tmp/nx-v22-migration-tests/js-test`

**Setup**:
- Added flat `releaseTagPattern*` properties to nx.json:
  - `releaseTagPattern: 'v{version}'`
  - `releaseTagPatternCheckAllBranchesWhen: true`
  - `releaseTagPatternRequireSemver: true`
  - `releaseTagPatternPreferDockerVersion: false`
  - `releaseTagPatternStrictPreid: false`

**Migration Result**:
- ✅ Successfully consolidated flat properties into nested `releaseTag` object structure:
  - `releaseTagPattern` → `releaseTag.pattern`
  - `releaseTagPatternCheckAllBranchesWhen` → `releaseTag.checkAllBranchesWhen`
  - `releaseTagPatternRequireSemver` → `releaseTag.requireSemver`
  - `releaseTagPatternPreferDockerVersion` → `releaseTag.preferDockerVersion`
  - `releaseTagPatternStrictPreid` → `releaseTag.strictPreid`
- ✅ Build verified successful after migration

**Files Changed**:
- `nx.json` - consolidated releaseTagPattern* properties into nested structure

**Git Branch**: `test-release-version-migration` in js-test workspace

**Note**: Both release migrations were tested together in the same migration run and both successfully transformed their respective configurations.

## Summary

**Completed**: 7/7 migrations tested - ALL SUCCESSFUL ✅
**Success Rate**: 100% (7/7 made expected changes)
**Issues Found**: None

**Key Findings**:
1. **JS migration** works with both explicit project.json and inferred projects
2. **React webpack migration** requires explicit `@nx/webpack:webpack` executor - doesn't detect inferred projects. Must use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspaces
3. **Next.js migration** requires explicit `@nx/next:build` executor - doesn't detect inferred projects. Must use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating workspaces
4. **Webpack migration** successfully removes both deprecated options with console logging
5. **Rspack migration** successfully removes both deprecated options
6. **Release version config migration** successfully promotes all `generatorOptions` properties to top-level in `release.version`
7. **Release tag consolidation migration** successfully consolidates `releaseTagPattern*` properties into nested `releaseTag` object structure
8. All migrations correctly handle cleanup of empty objects/properties
9. All migrations preserve other configuration options
10. Migrations that target specific deprecated options correctly skip projects that don't use those options

**Important Notes**:
- React, Next.js, Webpack, and Rspack migrations require **explicit executors** (in project.json or package.json) - they do not work with plugin-inferred projects
- Use `NX_ADD_PLUGINS=false` when creating/generating projects in v21 for testing webpack/Next.js/React migrations
- Release migrations work on nx.json, release groups, project.json, and package.json configurations
