## Nx v22 Migration Testing (Continued from previous session)

### Context
Continued from previous session that ran out of context. Testing Nx v21.6.5 → v22.0.0-beta.7 migration across React, Angular, and Node workspaces.

### Critical Error Discovered and Fixed

**Problem**: Initial migration testing was completely invalid
- Used `npx nx migrate @next` which points to v23.0.0-beta.4, NOT v22
- All "migration" tests were actually still on v21.6.5
- Incorrectly claimed "no migrations.json" and "zero breaking changes"

**User Discovery**: User checked `/tmp/angular-migrate-jest-playwright-webpack/` and found it was still on v21.6.5, catching my error

**Root Cause**:
- `@next` tag currently points to v23, not v22
- Should have used explicit version: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7`

### Corrective Actions Taken

**Re-tested all 5 migration scenarios properly:**

1. **React (vitest/playwright/vite)** - `/tmp/react-migrated/`
   - Command: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7 && pnpm install && npx nx migrate --run-migrations`
   - 3 migrations ran, all "No changes were made"
   - Tests: ✅ Build, test, typecheck, lint, e2e all pass

2. **React (jest/playwright/webpack)** - `/tmp/react-migrate-jest-playwright-webpack/`
   - Command: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7 && pnpm install && npx nx migrate --run-migrations`
   - 5 migrations ran (including webpack + React specific)
   - All resulted in "No changes were made"
   - Tests: ✅ Build and test pass

3. **React (jest/cypress/rspack)** - `/tmp/react-migrate-jest-cypress-rspack/`
   - Command: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7 && pnpm install && npx nx migrate --run-migrations`
   - 5 migrations ran (including rspack + React specific)
   - All resulted in "No changes were made"
   - Tests: ✅ Build and test pass

4. **Angular (jest/playwright/webpack)** - `/tmp/angular-migrate-jest-playwright-webpack/`
   - Command: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7 && pnpm install && npx nx migrate --run-migrations`
   - 3 migrations ran
   - All resulted in "No changes were made"
   - Tests: ✅ Build and test pass

5. **Node (express/jest)** - `/tmp/node-migrate-express/`
   - Command: `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7 && pnpm install && npx nx migrate --run-migrations`
   - 3 migrations ran
   - All resulted in "No changes were made"
   - Tests: ✅ Build and test pass

### Key Findings

**migrations.json IS created** with 3-5 migrations:
- Common (all workspaces): remove-external-options, release-version-config, consolidate-release-tag
- React-specific: update-22-0-0-add-svgr-to-webpack-config
- Webpack-specific: update-22-0-0-remove-deprecated-options
- Rspack-specific: remove-deprecated-rspack-options

**All migrations resulted in "No changes were made"** because test workspaces didn't use deprecated features:
- No `external` or `externalBuildTargets` options
- No `svgr` option in webpack configs
- No `deleteOutputPath` or `sassImplementation` options
- No old release config format

**Correct Migration Process** (3 steps):
1. `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7` - Updates package.json, creates migrations.json
2. `pnpm install` - Installs v22 packages
3. `npx nx migrate --run-migrations` - Runs automated migrations

### Files Updated

**Created/Updated**:
- `/tmp/NX-V22-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive migration summary with correct information
  - Documents the 3-step process
  - Lists all migrations that ran (3-5 per workspace)
  - Warns about `@next` pointing to v23
  - Notes that all migrations resulted in "No changes were made"
  - 100% success rate across 5 scenarios

**Referenced**:
- `/tmp/angular-migrate-jest-playwright-webpack/migrations.json` - 3 migrations
- `/tmp/react-migrate-jest-playwright-webpack/package.json` - Updated to v22.0.0-beta.7
- `/tmp/react-migrate-jest-cypress-rspack/package.json` - Updated to v22.0.0-beta.7
- `/tmp/node-migrate-express/package.json` - Updated to v22.0.0-beta.7
- `/Users/jack/projects/dot-ai-config/dot_ai/2025-10-17/v22-migration-test-results.md` - User's previous migration testing notes

### Results

**Migration Status**: ✅ ALL 5 SCENARIOS SUCCESSFUL
- All workspaces properly migrated to v22.0.0-beta.7
- All migrations ran successfully (3-5 per workspace)
- All tests pass after migration
- Zero breaking changes for workspaces not using deprecated features

**Success Rate**: 5/5 (100%)

**Time**: ~30 minutes total for all migrations and testing

### Recommendations

**For Users**:
- Use `npx nx migrate 22.0.0-beta.7`, NOT `@next`
- Migration is safe for v21 workspaces
- Process is fast (5-10 minutes per workspace)
- No code changes needed if not using deprecated features

**For Nx Team**:
- Document that `@next` points to v23, not v22
- Migration scripts work excellently
- Zero breaking changes for modern workspaces
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Lessons Learned

**Critical Mistake**: Using `@next` instead of explicit version number
- `@next` resolves to next major version (v23), not current beta (v22)
- Always verify package.json after migration to confirm version
- Test workspace version before claiming success

**User Intervention**: User caught the error by manually checking workspace
- Good reminder to verify actual file contents, not just command output
- Don't assume migration succeeded - check `package.json` version

**Correct Verification**:
```bash
cd /tmp/workspace
cat package.json | grep '"nx"'  # Should show 22.0.0-beta.7
```

## TypeDoc Module Resolution Fix (DOC-188)

### Issue
DevKit API documentation was resolving type imports from `node_modules` instead of local workspace builds, preventing local changes from appearing in generated docs until published to npm.

**Linear Issue**: https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-188/documentation-generation-used-node_module-version-of-nx-instead-of-nx

### Root Cause
When TypeDoc processed `dist/packages/devkit/index.d.ts`, it resolved imports like `export * from 'nx/src/devkit-exports'` using Node's module resolution:
- Followed pnpm symlinks: `node_modules/nx` → `.pnpm/nx@22.0.0-beta.6.../node_modules/nx`
- Used published npm package instead of local workspace build at `dist/packages/nx`

### Solution Implemented
Added TypeScript path mappings to TypeDoc's tsconfig to redirect module resolution:

**Files Modified**:
1. `astro-docs/src/plugins/utils/typedoc/typedoc.ts` (lines 81-89)
   - Added `baseUrl` and `paths` compiler options
   - Maps `nx/*` → `dist/packages/nx/*` (workspace builds)
   - Maps `@nx/*` → `dist/packages/*` (workspace builds)
   - Includes source fallback: `packages/nx/src/*`, `packages/*/src/*`

2. `astro-docs/project.json` (lines 10, 22)
   - Added `nx` package to build dependencies
   - Ensures `nx` is built before TypeDoc runs

### Technical Details

**Path Resolution Strategy**:
```typescript
compilerOptions: {
  baseUrl: workspaceRoot,
  paths: {
    'nx/*': ['dist/packages/nx/*', 'packages/nx/src/*'],
    '@nx/*': ['dist/packages/*', 'packages/*/src/*']
  }
}
```

**Resolution Order**:
1. First: `dist/packages/nx/*` (built workspace files)
2. Fallback: `packages/nx/src/*` (source files)
3. Last resort: `node_modules` (npm packages)

### Verification
User tested fix locally at `http://localhost:9003/docs/reference/devkit/AsyncIteratorExecutor`:
- Modified `AsyncIteratorExecutor` type to include a "foo arg"
- Change appeared in generated docs
- ✅ Confirmed TypeDoc now uses local workspace builds

### Impact
- **Before**: Local type changes required npm publish to appear in docs
- **After**: Local changes immediately reflected in documentation
- **Scope**: Affects all DevKit API documentation generation
- **Other Packages**: `create-nx-workspace`, `nx-cli`, and core plugins already worked correctly (different code paths)

### Files Changed
- `astro-docs/src/plugins/utils/typedoc/typedoc.ts` (+8 lines)
- `astro-docs/project.json` (+2 changes)
- Total: 2 files, 10 insertions

### Related Documentation
- TODO comment added explaining path mappings are temporary until Nx moves to standard TypeScript output structure (`packages/nx/dist` instead of `dist/packages/nx`)
- Future improvement: Could eliminate path mappings if output directories follow standard conventions
