# Topic for Victor 1:1: AI Productivity Metrics for Investors

**Date:** 2025-12-29

## Discussion Point

Would it be valuable to prepare some rough numbers showing engineering productivity increases due to AI assistance for investor conversations?

## The Pitch

If we can demonstrate that:
- Headcount remains flat (or grows slowly)
- Revenue continues to increase

Then there should be a measurable productivity gain that could be attributed (at least partially) to AI tooling adoption.

## Potential Metrics to Explore

- **Output per engineer**: PRs merged, features shipped, bugs fixed
- **Time to delivery**: Sprint velocity trends, cycle time improvements
- **Code quality**: Defect rates, time spent on code review
- **Cost efficiency**: Revenue per engineer over time

## Questions to Discuss

1. Do we have baseline data from before AI adoption?
2. What's our AI tooling stack? (Copilot, Claude, internal tools?)
3. Are there confounding factors to account for? (New hires ramping, architecture changes, etc.)
4. What narrative would resonate most with investors?
