# Task: Reproduce Nx Lockfile Error

## Task Description
Reproduce and investigate a lockfile error that occurs when running any Nx command. The error appears to be fixed by a reset, suggesting it might be related to a stale graph or cached state.

## Background
- Users are experiencing lockfile errors when running Nx commands
- The issue is resolved by performing a reset
- This suggests the problem might be related to stale cached data or graph state

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Nx Lockfile Implementation
**TODO:**
- [ ] Search for lockfile-related code in the Nx codebase
- [ ] Identify where lockfiles are created, read, and validated
- [ ] Look for graph-related lockfile operations
- [ ] Find reset functionality and what it clears

**Reasoning:** Understanding the lockfile implementation will help identify potential failure points and race conditions.

### Step 2: Create Minimal Reproduction Repository
**TODO:**
- [ ] Create a new minimal Nx workspace
- [ ] Add basic projects and dependencies
- [ ] Create scripts to simulate various scenarios

**Reasoning:** A minimal setup will help isolate the issue without unnecessary complexity.

### Step 3: Simulate Potential Lockfile Error Scenarios
**TODO:**
- [ ] Scenario 1: Corrupt lockfile content
- [ ] Scenario 2: Permission issues on lockfile
- [ ] Scenario 3: Concurrent Nx processes
- [ ] Scenario 4: Interrupted Nx process leaving stale lockfile
- [ ] Scenario 5: Graph cache corruption
- [ ] Scenario 6: Workspace configuration changes mid-operation

**Reasoning:** These scenarios cover common causes of lockfile issues in build systems.

### Step 4: Test Reset Behavior
**TODO:**
- [ ] Document what `nx reset` actually clears
- [ ] Test if manual deletion of specific files has same effect
- [ ] Identify minimum set of files/cache that need clearing

**Reasoning:** Understanding what reset does will pinpoint the exact cause.

### Step 5: Create Reproduction Scripts
**TODO:**
- [ ] Script to reliably trigger the error
- [ ] Script to verify the error state
- [ ] Script to demonstrate the fix via reset

**Reasoning:** Automated reproduction will help developers fix the issue.

## Implementation Plan

### Files to Create:
1. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/reproduce-lockfile/setup-repo.mjs` - Creates minimal Nx workspace
2. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/reproduce-lockfile/simulate-errors.mjs` - Simulates various error scenarios
3. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/reproduce-lockfile/test-reset.mjs` - Tests reset behavior
4. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/reproduce-lockfile/README.md` - Instructions for reproduction

### Analysis Scripts:
1. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/analyze-lockfile-code.mjs` - Analyzes Nx source for lockfile handling
2. `.ai/2025-01-27/tasks/trace-lockfile-operations.mjs` - Traces lockfile operations

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Reproduction Steps:** Clear, minimal steps to reproduce the lockfile error
2. **Root Cause:** Identification of why the lockfile error occurs
3. **Fix Verification:** Confirmation of why reset resolves the issue
4. **Recommendations:** Suggestions for preventing or handling the error better

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can reliably reproduce the lockfile error
- [ ] Understand the exact cause of the error
- [ ] Document minimal fix (what specific files/cache need clearing)
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations for a permanent fix

## Notes
- Focus on graph-related operations since reset fixing it suggests stale graph state
- Check for race conditions in concurrent Nx operations
- Investigate if specific Nx commands are more prone to this error

## CRITICAL: Implementation Tracking
**When implementing or executing on this task, keep track of progress in this section:**

### Progress Log:
<!-- Update this section as implementation proceeds -->
- [x] Step 1: Lockfile analysis - Completed
- [x] Step 2: Minimal repo creation - Completed
- [x] Step 3: Error scenario testing - Completed
- [x] Step 4: Reset behavior analysis - Completed
- [x] Step 5: Reproduction script creation - Completed

### Findings:
- **Key Files**: `.nx/workspace-data/lockfile.hash`, `parsed-lock-file.json`, `project-graph.json`
- **Root Cause**: Cache file corruption (especially `parsed-lock-file.json`) is the primary trigger
- **Why Reset Works**: Clears entire `.nx/workspace-data/` directory, forcing rebuild from scratch
- **Lock Mechanism**: Uses native FileLock (Rust) for runtime locks, but persistent cache files can become corrupted
- **Error Messages**: "Waiting for graph construction", parsing errors, daemon connection failures

### Reproduction Methods:
1. **Most Reliable**: Corrupt `parsed-lock-file.json` with invalid JSON
2. **Permission Issues**: Make `.nx/workspace-data` read-only
3. **Lockfile Mismatch**: Change package lockfile while keeping old hash
4. **Concurrent Modifications**: Multiple processes updating dependencies

### Issues Encountered:
- Nx has good error recovery, making it harder to trigger errors in normal use
- Most errors self-heal on next run unless cache files are corrupted
- The actual "lockfile error" users see is often a generic command failure
