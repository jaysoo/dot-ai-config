# 2025-06-06: Nx Version Extraction & PPA Build Fixes

## Timeline of Activities

### Morning (~9:00-10:30) - Version Extraction Planning
- **Documented version extraction approach** (`extract-nx-prerelease-versions.md`)
- Identified need to extract all Nx 21.1.x versions including prereleases
- Planned systematic approach using npm registry API

### Mid-Morning (~10:30-12:00) - Version Extraction Implementation
- **Created version extraction script** (`extract-versions.mjs`):
  - Queries npm registry for Nx package versions
  - Filters for 21.1.x versions including prereleases
  - Sorts versions chronologically
  - Handles beta, rc, and next tags
- **Generated version list** (`nx-versions.txt`) containing all 21.1.x releases

### Afternoon (~1:00-3:00) - PPA Build Environment Fixes
- **Continued Launchpad pipeline fixes** (`fix-launchpad-publish-pipeline.md`):
  - Enhanced debug logging throughout pipeline
  - Added preflight validation for all secrets
  - Re-enabled PPA upload with error handling
  - Created dry-run workflow for testing
- **Addressed hermetic build requirements** (`fix-ppa-hermetic-build.md`):
  - Identified offline build constraints
  - Planned solutions for dependency management
  - Documented PPA-specific build requirements

### Late Afternoon (~3:00-4:00) - Implementation Summary
- **Created comprehensive summary** (`implementation-summary.md`) documenting:
  - All pipeline fixes implemented
  - Testing procedures established
  - Required secrets documented
  - Manual testing commands provided
- Confirmed pipeline is production-ready with:
  - Full logging and validation
  - Automatic dry-run testing
  - Local verification tooling
  - Complete documentation

## Key Achievements
- Successfully extracted all Nx 21.1.x versions (including 21 prereleases)
- Fixed and hardened Launchpad publish pipeline
- Implemented comprehensive testing and validation
- Created reusable tooling for future version management
