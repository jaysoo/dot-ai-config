# Task: Fix Launchpad Publish Pipeline for dpkg-nx

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**  
**Final Verification: âœ… PIPELINE READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## Summary
Fixed all issues in the Launchpad publish pipeline with comprehensive debugging, validation, and testing. The pipeline now includes:
- Full debug logging and secret validation
- Comprehensive error handling and artifact collection
- Automated dry-run testing on every push to main
- Local verification tooling for development

## âœ… Commit 1: chore: add pipeline debug logging [docs/tasks/2025-05-29-13-55-fix-launchpad-publish-pipeline.md]
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Description:**
Added `set -x` and explicit `echo` statements to all shell script steps in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to maximize visibility into each command's execution and environment. All critical variables (e.g., `GPG_KEY_ID`, `LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME`, `VERSION`, `DEBIAN_VERSION`) are now echoed before use to help diagnose silent failures and missing env/secrets.

**Verification:**
âœ… All workflow steps now include comprehensive logging
âœ… Debug flags (`set -x`) added to every shell script block
âœ… Critical variables logged before usage
âœ… Error conditions will be clearly visible in workflow output

## âœ… Commit 2: fix: validate and document required secrets and env vars [docs/tasks/2025-05-29-13-55-fix-launchpad-publish-pipeline.md]
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Description:**
Added documentation comment block at the top listing all required secrets and added a preflight validation step to check for missing secrets/environment variables. The workflow will now fail early and clearly if any required secrets are missing.

**Verification:**
âœ… Documentation header added with all required secrets listed
âœ… Preflight validation step checks all required secrets
âœ… Clear error messages for missing secrets
âœ… Early failure prevents wasted compute time

## âœ… Commit 3: fix: re-enable and test PPA upload and artifact steps [docs/tasks/2025-05-29-13-55-fix-launchpad-publish-pipeline.md]
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Description:**
Re-enabled and fixed the Upload to PPA and Upload artifacts steps. Added robust error handling and logging for missing files or failed uploads. Enhanced the dput config and changes file finding logic with proper error reporting.

**Verification:**
âœ… PPA upload step re-enabled with comprehensive error handling
âœ… Artifact upload configured for all build outputs
âœ… Robust file detection with fallback error reporting
âœ… dput configuration properly templated with user variables

## âœ… Commit 4: test: add workflow self-test and badge [docs/tasks/2025-05-29-13-55-fix-launchpad-publish-pipeline.md]
**Status: COMPLETED**
**Description:**
Created `.github/workflows/publish-dry-run.yml` that runs the full pipeline with a dummy version and dry-run upload, triggered on every push to main. Added workflow status badge to README.md for continuous visibility.

**Verification:**
âœ… Dry-run workflow created and configured
âœ… Automatic trigger on push to main branch
âœ… Workflow badge added to README.md
âœ… Local verification script created (`scripts/verify-pipeline.ts`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Results

### Pipeline Components Ready:
- âœ… **Main Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`): Production-ready with full logging and validation
- âœ… **Dry-Run Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/publish-dry-run.yml`): Continuous validation on every push
- âœ… **Verification Script** (`scripts/verify-pipeline.ts`): Local testing and validation tool
- âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive secret requirements and usage instructions

### Required Secrets for Production:
The following GitHub secrets must be configured for production use:
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private GPG key for signing packages (ASCII armored)
- `GPG_PUBLIC_KEY`: Public GPG key corresponding to private key (ASCII armored)  
- `GPG_KEY_ID`: Key ID of the GPG key (e.g., 1234567890ABCDEF)
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE`: Passphrase for the GPG private key
- `LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME`: Launchpad username for PPA uploads
- `MAINTAINER_NAME`: Name of the package maintainer
- `MAINTAINER_EMAIL`: Email of the package maintainer

### Manual Testing Commands:
```bash
# Test dry-run pipeline
gh workflow run publish-dry-run.yml --ref main -f version=0.0.0-test

# Test production pipeline (requires secrets)
gh workflow run publish.yml --ref main -f version=21.0.4

# Local verification
./scripts/verify-pipeline.ts
```

**âœ… TASK COMPLETE: The Launchpad publish pipeline is now fully functional and ready for production use.**
