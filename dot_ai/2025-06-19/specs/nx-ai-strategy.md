# Nx AI Agenda

## Context

- We updated our tagline to mention "AI-first", so let's keep pushing in that direction
- Need to align on tools to support and user experience to provide
- We should build strategic partnerships to advocate for Nx in the AI world

## Current State

- **Local MCP**: Shipped as `nx-mcp`
- **Cloud MCP**: Handles multi-repo management and CI
- **Explain with AI**: Shipped in Nx Cloud
- **Agent allocation**: Shipped in Nx Cloud, but not used
- **Documentation AI Chat**: Exists but not strategic focus

## Two-Day Session Agenda

**Understanding the Landscape**:
- Demo current capabilities (Victor or Jon)
  - MCP tools
  - Self-healing CI
  - etc.
- AI landscape audit: Current MCPs, integrations, adoption metrics
- User research findings: How are users using AI, what prompts, etc. (can look at AI Chat anlaytics)
- Competitive analysis: How other tools approach AI

**Strategic Deep Dive**:
- Product differentiation 
  - What is Nx's unique selling proposition (USP) as an AI-first platform?
  - How can Nx's AI capabilities attract new user segments and expand market presence? 
  - What are potential monetization strategies for advanced AI features?

**Enhancing User Experience and Adoption Through AI**
  - How do we onboard new users to the AI capabilities?
    - AI-focused onboarding experience to Nx
    - Onboarding for existing users
  - How will users understand why AI did something, and how much control do they have over outputs?
    - What happens when the AI isn't confident or makes a mistake?
    - How will users provide feedback for AI improvement?
  - Local vs Organizational intelligence
    - CLI MCP for local code, and Cloud MCP to connect through Polygraph

**Technical Discussion**:
- API and MCP architecture review and improvements
  - Roll `nx-mcp` back into Nx CLI
  - Move nx.dev Next.js API somewhere else?
- Documentation AI-readiness assessment
  - How do we measure and automate?
- Verification/validation strategy for AI-generated code
- Local vs Cloud intelligence boundaries

**Partnerships & Ecosystem**
- Who?
  - AI companies (Graphite, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc.)
  - IDE vendors (VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor)
  - Opensource AI-tools as part of outreach
  - etc.
- Promotion of MCP capabilities
- Joint go-to-market strategies

**Roadmap & Action**
- Feature prioritization matrix (effort vs value)
- Come up with a roadmap for the next 1-3-6 months
- Resource allocation and team structure

## Key Deliverables
