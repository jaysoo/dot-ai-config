# Today's Getting Started Analysis Checklist

## Phase 1: Clarification and Setup âœ…

### Current State Assessment
- [x] **Document the current Nx getting started structure**
  - Located at `/docs/shared/getting-started/intro.md`
  - Uses Diataxis documentation model
  - Multiple entry paths available
  - Interactive tutorials exist but separate

### Phase 1 Definition
**Phase 1 Focus**: Research, analyze, and create actionable plan with mockups for improving the Nx getting started experience at `nx.dev/getting-started/intro`.

**Not in scope for Phase 1**:
- Homepage redesign (nx.dev main landing)
- Deep technical implementation
- A/B testing setup

## Analysis Tasks for Today

### 1. Competitor Research (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Run the analysis script**: `node .ai/2025-06-05/analyze-competitor-docs.mjs`
- [ ] **Visit each competitor site** and document:
  - [ ] TurboRepo (turbo.build/repo/docs)
  - [ ] Moon (moonrepo.dev/docs)
  - [ ] SST (sst.dev/docs)
  - [ ] Vite (vitejs.dev/guide)
  - [ ] Next.js (nextjs.org/docs)
  - [ ] Remix (remix.run/docs)
  - [ ] Astro (docs.astro.build)

### 2. Critical Analysis (1 hour)
- [ ] **Time each getting started flow** (stopwatch from landing to first success)
- [ ] **Screenshot key interactions** for reference
- [ ] **Note mobile experience** quality
- [ ] **Identify 3 best practices** per site

### 3. Mockup Creation (2 hours)
- [ ] **Review the HTML mockup** (`.ai/2025-06-05/getting-started-mockup.html`)
- [ ] **Create variations** based on competitor insights:
  - [ ] Version A: Current style improved
  - [ ] Version B: Path-focused approach
  - [ ] Version C: Interactive-first design
- [ ] **Sketch mobile layouts** (can be hand-drawn photos)

### 4. Content Audit (1 hour)
- [ ] **Current intro page analysis**:
  - [ ] Word count and reading time
  - [ ] Information density score
  - [ ] Call-to-action effectiveness
  - [ ] Visual-to-text ratio
- [ ] **Gap identification**:
  - [ ] Missing immediate value demo
  - [ ] Unclear time expectations
  - [ ] No progress indicators

## Research Questions to Answer

### User Experience
1. **Time to Value**: How long until users see something working?
2. **Cognitive Load**: How much information before first action?
3. **Error Recovery**: What happens when commands fail?
4. **Success Indicators**: How do users know they succeeded?

### Design Patterns
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: How do sites reveal complexity?
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: What gets attention first?
3. **Interactive Elements**: Which interactions drive engagement?
4. **Mobile Optimization**: How do sites adapt for touch?

### Content Strategy
1. **Value Proposition**: How quickly is value communicated?
2. **Personalization**: How do sites handle different user types?
3. **Social Proof**: What trust signals are used?
4. **Next Steps**: How do sites guide continued engagement?

## Output Deliverables

### Research Artifacts
- [ ] **Competitor analysis files** (7 individual .md files)
- [ ] **Comparison matrix** with ratings
- [ ] **Key insights summary** with recommendations
- [ ] **Screenshot collection** (store in mockups/ folder)

### Design Artifacts
- [ ] **Mockup variations** (HTML files)
- [ ] **Mobile wireframes** (images or sketches)
- [ ] **User flow diagrams** (can be simple)
- [ ] **Component inventory** (buttons, cards, etc.)

### Strategy Artifacts
- [ ] **Improved content outline** for intro page
- [ ] **Implementation priority matrix** (effort vs impact)
- [ ] **Success metrics definition**
- [ ] **Testing approach** (what to measure)

## Quick Commands for Today

```bash
# Open mockup in browser
open .ai/2025-06-05/getting-started-mockup.html

# Run competitor analysis script
node .ai/2025-06-05/analyze-competitor-docs.mjs

# Serve current Nx docs locally for comparison
nx serve-docs nx-dev

# View current intro page
open http://localhost:4200/getting-started/intro
```

## End of Day Review

### Decision Points
- [ ] **Which design direction** resonates most?
- [ ] **What's the #1 improvement** to implement first?
- [ ] **Which competitor feature** should Nx adopt?
- [ ] **What timeline** is realistic for implementation?

### Next Session Planning
- [ ] **Priority improvements** list
- [ ] **Content writing** tasks
- [ ] **Technical requirements** for development
- [ ] **Testing strategy** for new approach

## Success Criteria for Today

1. **Complete understanding** of competitor landscape
2. **Clear vision** for improved Nx getting started experience
3. **Actionable mockups** ready for feedback
4. **Prioritized roadmap** for implementation
5. **Measurable goals** defined for success
