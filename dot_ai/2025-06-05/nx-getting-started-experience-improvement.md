# Nx Getting Started Experience Improvement Plan

## Date: June 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to analyze and improve the Nx getting started experience at nx.dev/getting-started/intro, drawing inspiration from industry-leading documentation sites while maintaining Nx's unique value proposition.

## Phase 1: Competitive Analysis & Current State Assessment (Today's Focus)

### 1.1 Competitor Documentation Analysis

#### Sites to Analyze:
1. **TurboRepo** (turbo.build/repo/docs)
   - Clear progressive disclosure
   - Interactive examples
   - Strong "Why Turbo" section

2. **Moon** (moonrepo.dev/docs)
   - Task-focused onboarding
   - Visual project structure diagrams
   - Step-by-step guides

3. **SST** (sst.dev/docs)
   - Interactive playground
   - Quick start templates
   - Framework-specific paths

4. **Vite** (vitejs.dev/guide)
   - Immediate value demonstration
   - "Get Started" in < 1 minute
   - Clear feature showcase

5. **Next.js** (nextjs.org/docs)
   - Interactive tutorial
   - Clear learning paths
   - Automatic setup options

### 1.2 Current Nx Getting Started Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Multiple entry paths (new workspace, existing project)
- Interactive tutorials available
- Framework-agnostic approach
- Strong video content

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Information density on intro page
- Lack of visual project structure representation
- No immediate "wow" moment
- Missing interactive code examples
- No clear time estimates for getting started

### 1.3 Key Metrics to Track
- Time to first successful command
- Bounce rate on intro page
- Tutorial completion rates
- Support ticket volume for getting started issues

## Phase 2: Proposed Improvements

### 2.1 Restructure Getting Started Flow

**New Structure:**
```
/getting-started/
  ├── intro (30-second overview + paths)
  ├── quickstart (< 5 minutes to running app)
  ├── core-concepts (visual, interactive)
  ├── your-first-project (guided tutorial)
  └── next-steps (personalized paths)
```

### 2.2 Key Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Interactive examples over text explanations
3. **Personalized Paths**: Different routes for different user types
4. **Time Estimates**: Clear expectations for each section
5. **Visual First**: Diagrams before paragraphs

### 2.3 Content Improvements

#### Intro Page Redesign:
- **Hero Section**: 
  - One-line value prop
  - 3 key benefits (with icons)
  - Primary CTA: "Start in 2 minutes"
  - Secondary CTA: "See it in action" (demo video)

- **Choose Your Path**:
  ```
  [ ] Starting Fresh       [ ] Existing Monorepo    [ ] Single Project
      → Quickstart            → Add Nx                → Convert to Monorepo
  ```

- **Visual Architecture**:
  - Interactive project graph preview
  - Before/After CI time comparison
  - Cache hit visualization

#### Quickstart Experience:
```bash
# One command to rule them all
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myapp --preset=react --interactive

# Immediate feedback
✓ Workspace created
✓ Dependencies installed
✓ Dev server ready at http://localhost:4200
✓ Try these commands:
  - nx graph (see your project structure)
  - nx test (run tests with caching)
  - nx build (production build)
```

## Phase 3: Mockup & Prototyping Strategy

### 3.1 Tools for Mockups

1. **Low-Fidelity**:
   - Excalidraw sketches
   - Markdown with ASCII diagrams
   - Wireframe tools (Whimsical, Balsamiq)

2. **High-Fidelity**:
   - Figma components matching nx.dev design system
   - CodeSandbox for interactive examples
   - Storybook for component variations

### 3.2 Mockup Deliverables

1. **Landing Flow Mockup**:
   - Hero section variations (A/B test candidates)
   - Path selection interface
   - Progress indicators

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Command palette preview
   - Project graph mini-visualization
   - Speed comparison animations

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Responsive command copying
   - Touch-friendly navigation
   - Condensed information hierarchy

### 3.3 Creating Mockups

Store all mockups in: `.ai/2025-06-05/mockups/`
- `intro-page-v1.svg` - Main layout
- `path-selector.html` - Interactive prototype
- `quickstart-flow.md` - Step-by-step wireframes

## Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Research & Design
- [ ] Complete competitor analysis matrix
- [ ] User journey mapping
- [ ] Create mockup variations
- [ ] Gather team feedback

### Week 2: Content Creation
- [ ] Rewrite intro page copy
- [ ] Create interactive examples
- [ ] Record quickstart video
- [ ] Design visual assets

### Week 3: Development
- [ ] Implement new page layouts
- [ ] Add interactive components
- [ ] Set up A/B testing
- [ ] Mobile optimization

### Week 4: Testing & Launch
- [ ] Internal team testing
- [ ] Community preview
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Gradual rollout

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Required Components:
1. **Path Selector Component**
   - Framework detection
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Progress tracking

2. **Interactive Code Examples**

   - 30% increase in tutorial starts
   - 25% faster time to first command

2. **Satisfaction**:
   - User feedback scores > 4.5/5
   - Reduced support tickets
   - Positive social media mentions

3. **Adoption**:
   - Increased workspace creations
   - Higher retention after 30 days
   - More migrations from other tools

## Next Steps for Today

1. Create competitor analysis matrix (see script below)
2. Sketch initial mockups
3. Write improved intro page copy
4. Create interactive prototype
5. Document findings and recommendations

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we will have:
- Comprehensive understanding of best practices in developer documentation
- Clear vision for improved Nx getting started experience
- Mockups and prototypes for testing
- Actionable implementation plan
- Metrics framework for measuring success

The improved getting started experience will reduce friction for new users, clearly communicate Nx's value proposition, and create a delightful first impression that converts visitors into active Nx users.
