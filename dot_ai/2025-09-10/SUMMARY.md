## Ocean Repository - Docker Nx Release Migration

### Work Completed
Implemented nx release support for Docker images in Ocean repository (NXC-2493), enabling the use of @nx/docker plugin while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing pipeline.

### Key Changes
1. **Dockerfile Migration**
   - Moved all Dockerfiles from `apps/docker-setup/dockerfiles/` to their respective project directories
   - Renamed all files to `Dockerfile` (removed .dockerfile extension)
   - Special handling for workflow controller with 3 separate Docker images

2. **Project Configuration**
   - Added `docker:build` targets to all Docker projects
   - Created new project.json files for workflow-executor and log-uploader
   - Configured minimal targets with only `cwd: ""` and `file` options

3. **Release Configuration**
   - Configured "apps" release group in nx.json with all Docker projects
   - Added skipVersionActions for non-JS projects
   - Set repository names to jaysoo83/ scope for testing

4. **CI/CD Updates**
   - Added workflow_dispatch input to CI workflow for toggling nx release
   - Updated build-and-publish-to-snapshot.sh with NX_RELEASE_DOCKER conditional
   - Updated package-scripts.js to reference new Dockerfile locations

### Lessons Learned
- Dockerfiles must be named exactly `Dockerfile` for nx/docker plugin
- @nx/docker builds from project directory, but Ocean needs workspace root context
- Java/Kotlin apps need skipVersionActions since they lack package.json
- Workflow controller needed special handling with sub-projects in cmd/

### Files Modified
- `nx.json`
- `tools/build-and-publish-to-snapshot.sh`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `package-scripts.js`
- All app project.json files
- All Dockerfiles (moved and renamed)
