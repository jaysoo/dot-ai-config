## Maven Plugin Paywall Discussion

- Strong internal pushback against gating Maven plugin
  - Colum against it
  - James raised issues during all hands
  - General team sentiment opposed
- Victor wants to proceed despite feedback
  - No clear path to revenue generation identified
  - Arbitrary gating vs strategic approach unclear
- Jason's perspective:
  - Feels like "extreme measure" due to resource constraints
  - Concerned about underlying company health implications
  - Not motivated by growth but by survival/funding needs

## Strategic Concerns & Alternative Approach

- Current approach lacks clarity on:
  - Where to draw paid vs free line
  - How Maven gating generates enterprise revenue
  - Differentiation from AI-powered features (V+)
- Proposed focus shift:
  - Prioritize existing revenue-generating features (CPU tracking, I/O tracing)
  - Gate new Maven features that integrate with Cloud platform
  - Develop pipeline of paid features instead of retroactively gating existing ones

## Team Capacity & Priorities

- Jason committed to focusing energy on revenue-generating features
  - Willing to let some maintenance slide if necessary
  - Suggests delaying non-critical updates (e.g., Prettier V3 support)
- Current week priorities:
  - Jason catching up, handling FE reviews
  - Tracing work coordination with Altan scheduled
  - UI work with Nicole can wait

## Upcoming Deliverables

- Zach's CLI/Nx livestream for 22.3 features
  - Jason will attend instead of Jack
  - Focus on shipped features, not roadmap
  - Can mention beta features like full screen
- Platform roadmap ownership:
  - Victor writing comprehensive platform roadmap
  - Team roadmap publication delayed until Victor's complete

## Next Steps

- [ ] Jack to discuss Maven decision with Victor this week
  - Push for clarity on revenue path or abandon gating
  - Address underlying motivations not clearly communicated
- [ ] Colum reviewing outdated plugins for deprecation decisions
- [ ] Team to develop more revenue-focused feature pipeline
