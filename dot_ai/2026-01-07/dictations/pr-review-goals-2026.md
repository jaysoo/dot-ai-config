# PR Review Goals for 2026

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Context:** Topic for upcoming 1:1s with Victor, Jason, Nicole, Altan, and Colum

## Goals

- **TTM (Time to Merge):** Under 24 hours, ideally under 12 hours
- **TTFR (Time to First Review):** Under 24 hours, ideally under 12 hours

## Strategy: Leverage AI for PR Reviews

Encourage team members to use AI tools to help with the review process:

### Example AI Prompts for PR Review

1. **Prioritization:**
   > "Give me a list of PRs I need to review and sort them by LOCs changed to help me prioritize small ones."

2. **Quick Summaries:**
   > "Can you give me a quick summary of the changes for each PR?"

3. **PR Description Quality:**
   > Use AI to ensure PR descriptions are clear and apt before submitting

### Benefits

- Faster initial review by understanding changes quickly
- Better prioritization (tackle small PRs first to reduce queue)
- Improved PR descriptions lead to faster reviews from others
- AI can flag potential issues or areas needing closer attention
