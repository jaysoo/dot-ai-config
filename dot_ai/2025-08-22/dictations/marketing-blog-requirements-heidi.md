# Marketing & Blog Platform Requirements - Conversation with Heidi

## Context

We are migrating away from the current Next.js + Vercel setup for the blog and marketing pages. This is an opportunity to choose a framework that better fits our actual workflow and the needs of the marketing team.

## Conversation Summary

### Initial Requirements Gathering

**Jack's Initial Outreach (1:50 PM)**

Collecting requirements for blog/marketing pages revamp as part of migration away from Next.js + Vercel. Key pain points previously identified:
- Adding and updating content without going through code reviews (e.g., banners for conferences/webinars)
- Being able to schedule content (particularly for blog posts)

### Heidi's Requirements Response (8:32 PM)

## Core Requirements

### Content Management & Publishing
- **No-code content updates**: Adding and updating content without going through code reviews (including banners for conferences/webinars)
- **Draft/Preview modes**: Test changes before publishing
- **Content versioning and rollback**: Not required but would be a plus
- **Rich media management**: Images, videos, documents

### Campaign & Landing Page Creation
- **Template-based landing page builders**: Current HubSpot supports this but the output looks awful
- **Form builders with CRM integrations**: Current HubSpot has this but it's very limited
- **Pop-up and banner management systems**

### Testing & Optimization
- **Built-in A/B testing capabilities**
- **Heatmap and analytics integration**: Not sure how common this is, but would be a huge value add
- **SEO tools**: Meta tags, schema markup, sitemap generation

## Nice-to-Have Features

### Content Strategy Support
- **Content scheduling**
- **Content tagging**
- **Content performance analytics**: Currently done manually in Google Analytics - could be nice to remove this manual step

### Technical Marketing Needs
- **Marketing automation platform integrations**
- **Customer data platform connections**
- **Third-party tool embeds**: Calendars, demos, calculators
- **Personalization capabilities**: Might be marketed as landing page personalization or Account Based Marketing (ABM) tooling

## Key Considerations

1. **Current Pain Points with HubSpot**:
   - Landing page builder produces poor visual results
   - Form builder has limited functionality

2. **Process Improvements Needed**:
   - Eliminate code review bottleneck for content changes
   - Enable marketing team autonomy for rapid campaign deployment
   - Improve visual quality compared to current HubSpot output

3. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Must work with existing CRM systems
   - Should integrate with current marketing automation stack
   - Analytics and tracking capabilities are essential

## Next Steps

- Evaluate platform options against these requirements
- Heidi is available to review options and provide feedback
- Consider both technical requirements and marketing team usability
