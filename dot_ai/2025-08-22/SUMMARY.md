# Daily Summary - August 22, 2025

## Active Tasks

### DOC-154: Fix URL Redirects from nx.dev to Astro docs
- **Status**: In Progress - Continued from 2025-08-21
- **Plan**: `tasks/doc-154-redirect-fixes-continuation.md`
- **Issue**: Redirects configured but not working (only 36% success rate)
- **Problem**: nx-dev doing internal rewrites instead of cross-server redirects
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Investigate NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL mechanism in nx-dev
  2. Check if rewrites are being used instead of redirects
  3. Fix implementation for proper cross-server redirects
  4. Re-test all 167 redirects

### Marketing & Blog Platform Requirements Gathering
- Created dictation from conversation with Heidi about requirements
- Document: `dictations/marketing-blog-requirements-heidi.md`
- Status: In Progress - Requirements documented, awaiting platform evaluation

## Key Context from Yesterday (DOC-154)

### Work Completed
- ✅ Fixed 56 failed URL redirects in `nx-dev/nx-dev/redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js`
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `.ai/2025-08-21/tasks/`
- ✅ Tested redirects with local servers (Astro on 9003, nx-dev on 4200)
- ❌ Discovered redirects not working as expected

### Technical Findings
- **Expected**: Redirect to `http://localhost:9003/path` (Astro server)
- **Actual**: Internal rewrite to `http://localhost:4200/wrong-path` (nx-dev)
- **Root Cause**: NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL not properly triggering cross-server redirects
- **Commit**: `3e44d22b66` - docs(misc): add redirects from nx.dev to new Astro docs

### Test Environment
```bash
# Astro server
cd astro-docs && npx astro dev --port 9003

# nx-dev with redirect URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL=http://localhost:9003 nx run nx-dev:serve:development
```

## Notes

The redirect configuration is correct but the nx-dev application may need code changes to properly handle cross-server redirects when NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL is set.

Marketing team needs significant autonomy for content management without code reviews. Current HubSpot limitations are a major pain point.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate nx-dev redirect mechanism implementation
2. Fix cross-server redirect handling
3. Re-test all 167 configured redirects
4. Evaluate platform options against marketing requirements
5. Share options with Heidi for feedback
