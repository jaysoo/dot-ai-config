## Overall Impressions

Everyone was happy and had fun. We got some good results despite not having a lot of communication or interactions throughout the day.

## Retrospective

The lack of communication was somewhat expected since we're all remote. If we do this again, we should consider having more coordination and fanfare to make it feel more collaborative.
