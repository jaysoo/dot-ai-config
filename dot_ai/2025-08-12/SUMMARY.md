## Work Performed

### Documentation Callout Migration Fix
**Time:** Afternoon
**Branch:** DOC-110

#### Task
Reverted aside tags that had replaced deepdive callouts back to the correct deepdive callout format to save screen space in the documentation.

#### Analysis Performed
1. Searched original `/docs` folder for all deepdive callouts (excluding blog)
2. Identified 14 files with 19 total deepdive callouts
3. Found corresponding files in `/astro-docs` that had been incorrectly converted
4. Discovered that `{% callout type="deepdive" %}` was being converted to `{% aside type="note" %}` or similar

#### Files Modified
1. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/intro.mdoc`
   - Line 21: Reverted aside to deepdive callout
   - Title: "What do you mean by 'running NPM scripts'?"

2. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/features/CI Features/dynamic-agents.mdoc`
   - Line 52: Reverted aside to deepdive callout
   - Title: "How is the size of the PR determined?"

3. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/enterprise/Powerpack Features/licenses-and-trials.mdoc`
   - Line 9: Reverted aside to deepdive callout
   - Title: "Looking for self-hosted caching?"

4. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/concepts/CI Concepts/reduce-waste.mdoc`
   - Line 256: Reverted aside to deepdive callout
   - Title: "The Math Behind the Expected Number of Affected Projects"

5. `astro-docs/src/content/docs/enterprise/activate-powerpack.mdoc`
   - Line 13: Reverted aside to deepdive callout - "Looking for self-hosted caching?"
   - Line 27: Reverted aside to deepdive callout - "Need a trial?"

#### Technical Details
- Deepdive callouts are configured in `astro-docs/markdoc.config.mjs`
- They use the Callout component, not the Aside component
- Deepdive type is designed to be collapsible by default for better UX

#### Status
âœ… Completed - 6 deepdive callouts successfully reverted across 5 files

## Notes
- Several cache plugin documentation files (azure-cache, s3-cache, gcs-cache, shared-fs-cache) have not been migrated to astro-docs yet
- Blog posts contain many deepdive callouts but were not part of this migration task
