# Playwright Header Pages Verification Report
Generated: 2025-09-11

## Summary
Checked all pages accessible from the header navigation to verify documentation links are correctly using `/docs/` prefixes when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL` is set.

## Pages Verified

### 1. Homepage (/)
✅ **Most links correctly updated**
- Header "Docs" link: `/docs/getting-started/intro` ✅
- Footer "Docs" link: `/docs/features/ci-features` ✅
- "While Scaling" section links all use `/docs/` ✅

❌ **Still using old paths (but these will be replaced anyway):**
- "While Coding" section: `/features/`, `/concepts/`, `/recipes/`
- "While Running CI" section: `/ci/features/`

### 2. AI Page (/ai)
✅ **All documentation links correctly updated**
- All links use `/docs/` prefix:
  - `/docs/getting-started/intro`
  - `/docs/getting-started/ai-setup`
  - `/docs/features/ci-features/flaky-tasks`
  - `/docs/features/ci-features/dynamic-agents`
  - `/docs/features/ci-features`

### 3. Nx Cloud Page (/nx-cloud)
✅ **All documentation links correctly updated**
- All links use `/docs/` prefix:
  - `/docs/getting-started/intro`
  - `/docs/features/ci-features/remote-cache`
  - `/docs/features/ci-features/distribute-task-execution`
  - `/docs/reference` (for Credit Pricing)
  - `/docs/features/ci-features`

### 4. Enterprise Page (/enterprise)
✅ **Most links correctly updated**
- Header and footer docs links use `/docs/` ✅

❌ **Two links still need fixing:**
- Configure Conformance Rules: `/ci/recipes/enterprise/conformance/configure-conformance-rules-in-nx-cloud`
- Publish Conformance Rules: `/ci/recipes/enterprise/conformance/publish-conformance-rules-to-nx-cloud`

## Files That Need Updates

### Enterprise Page Conformance Links
File: `nx-dev/ui-enterprise/src/lib/enterprise-polygraph.tsx` (or similar)
- Need to update the two conformance recipe links to use conditional logic

## Conclusion

The implementation is mostly complete. The header-accessible pages (AI, Nx Cloud, Enterprise) have their documentation links properly updated with conditional logic based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL`. 

Only two links on the Enterprise page still need to be updated to use the `/docs/` prefix when ASTRO_URL is set.

The homepage still has some static links in the "While Coding" and "While Running CI" sections, but since those old pages (`/features/`, `/concepts/`, `/recipes/`, `/getting-started/`) will be replaced with their `/docs/` counterparts, this is acceptable as noted by the user.
