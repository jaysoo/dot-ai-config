# Playwright Link Verification Summary
Generated: 2025-09-11

## Summary

Successfully verified that when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL=https://canary.nx.dev` is set, the documentation links on the homepage are correctly updated to use `/docs/` prefixes.

## Verification Results

### ✅ Links correctly using /docs/ prefix:
1. **Header Docs link**: `/docs/getting-started/intro`
2. **Documentation CTA**: `/docs/getting-started/intro?utm_medium=...`
3. **Footer Docs link**: `/docs/features/ci-features`
4. **While Scaling section**:
   - Clear project boundaries: `/docs/features/enforce-module-boundaries`
   - Ownership: `/docs/enterprise/powerpack/owners`
   - Conformance rules: `/docs/enterprise/powerpack/conformance`
   - Nx plugins: `/docs/plugin-registry`
   - Code generation: `/docs/features/generate-code`
   - Automated updates: `/docs/features/automate-updating-dependencies`

### ❌ Links still using old paths (need fixing):
These links in the "While Coding" and "While Running CI" sections still need conditional logic:
1. `/concepts/decisions/why-monorepos`
2. `/features/run-tasks`
3. `/features/cache-task-results`
4. `/recipes/running-tasks/terminal-ui`
5. `/concepts/nx-plugins`
6. `/features/enhance-AI`
7. `/getting-started/intro` (in "Learn more about Nx" link)
8. `/ci/features/remote-cache`
9. `/ci/features/distribute-task-execution`
10. `/ci/features/self-healing-ci`

### Files that still need updates:
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/features/features-while-coding.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/features/features-while-running-ci.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/features/features.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/work-better-achieve-more-ship-quicker.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/ci-for-monorepos.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/monorepo-ai-support.tsx`
- `nx-dev/ui-home/src/lib/smarter-tools-for-monorepos.tsx`

## Conclusion

The implementation is partially complete. The footer and some documentation links have been properly updated with conditional logic based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL`. However, several components in the `ui-home` package still contain static links that need to be updated with the same conditional pattern.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Update the remaining files in `nx-dev/ui-home` to use conditional logic
2. Re-run the Playwright verification to confirm all links are working correctly
3. Test navigation to ensure no 308 redirects occur when ASTRO_URL is set
