# React Monorepo Tutorial Update Task

**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Goal**: Transform the React monorepo tutorial to focus on onboarding users to the full Nx platform, emphasizing CI/Nx Cloud as prerequisites and simplifying concepts to showcase immediate value.

## Background

The current tutorial needs to be updated to:
1. Position CI and Nx Cloud as required prerequisites (not optional)
2. Replace `affected` commands with `run-many` to avoid explaining affected concepts
3. Remove the second app and focus on a single app with libraries
4. Integrate self-healing CI content
5. Remove module boundaries and deployment sections

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Unnecessary Content
- [x] Remove "Add Another Application" section
- [x] Remove all references to the inventory app
- [x] Remove "Handling Port Conflicts" section
- [x] Remove deployment section
- [x] Remove module boundaries mentions

### Phase 2: Update Commands and Concepts
- [x] Replace all `nx affected` commands with `nx run-many`
- [x] Remove explanations about how affected works
- [x] Update command outputs to reflect run-many

### Phase 3: Restructure Tutorial Flow
- [x] Add prerequisite callout for CI and Nx Cloud at the beginning
- [x] Move CI section earlier (after testing)
- [x] Make Nx Cloud connection mandatory
- [x] Integrate self-healing CI content

### Phase 4: Content Updates
- [x] Update introduction to emphasize "Nx platform" for all team sizes
- [x] Update workspace creation to ensure CI is selected
- [x] Simplify library examples (remove inventory app usage)
- [x] Update project graph visualization
- [x] Update testing section with run-many

### Phase 5: Polish and Verify
- [x] Ensure all code examples work
- [x] Verify command outputs are accurate
- [x] Check that the flow is logical and focused
- [ ] Update any screenshots/diagrams references

## Expected Changes

### Sections to Remove:
1. Lines 240-339: "Add Another Application" and port conflicts
2. Lines 723-789: Deployment section
3. All inventory app references throughout
4. Module boundaries mentions

### Sections to Update:
1. Introduction: Add CI/Nx Cloud prerequisite callout
2. Testing section: Change affected to run-many
3. CI section: Move earlier, make mandatory, add self-healing
4. Library usage: Simplify to just react-store app

### New Tutorial Flow:
1. Introduction with prerequisites
2. Create workspace (CI required)
3. Serve the app
4. Create and use local library
5. Testing with run-many
6. Connect to Nx Cloud (mandatory)
7. Configure CI with self-healing
8. Next steps

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status: Completed! 

### Implementation Summary:

1. **Removed unnecessary content**:
   - Removed entire "Add Another Application" section
   - Removed all references to inventory app throughout
   - Removed deployment section
   - Replaced module boundaries mentions with general organization guidance

2. **Updated commands and concepts**:
   - Replaced all `nx affected` commands with `nx run-many`
   - Removed affected explanations
   - Updated the project graph visualization to show only react-store

3. **Restructured for platform focus**:
   - Added prominent prerequisite callout for CI/Nx Cloud at beginning
   - Moved CI section after testing/caching section
   - Made CI/Nx Cloud connection mandatory
   - Added comprehensive self-healing CI content

4. **Content improvements**:
   - Updated introduction to emphasize "Nx platform" benefits
   - Added callout to ensure CI provider selection during setup
   - Simplified examples to focus on single app with libraries
   - Updated all command outputs to be consistent

### Key Changes Made:
- Tutorial now positions Nx as a complete platform solution, not just local dev tools
- CI and Nx Cloud are presented as core requirements, not optional features
- Self-healing CI is prominently featured as a key benefit
- Simplified architecture (one app instead of two) makes tutorial more focused
- Using `run-many` throughout avoids explaining affected commands

## CRITICAL: Implementation Tracking
All phases completed successfully. The tutorial now provides a streamlined onboarding experience focused on the full Nx platform value proposition.
