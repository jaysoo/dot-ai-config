# Task: Convert nx-stat-publisher to Google Apps Script

## Task Type
**Enhancement/Migration** - Converting existing Node.js script to Google Apps Script for automated scheduled execution

## Objective
Convert the `npx nx run-publisher nx-stat-publisher --report=monthly-npm-downloads` script to a Google Apps Script that can be scheduled to run weekly on Google Drive, updating a company spreadsheet with NPM download statistics.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Understanding
- [ ] Examine the nx-stat-publisher codebase structure
- [ ] Understand the monthly-npm-downloads report functionality
- [ ] Identify all external dependencies and API calls
- [ ] Map out the data flow from NPM API to Google Sheets
- [ ] Assess compatibility with Google Apps Script limitations

### Phase 2: Design Google Apps Script Architecture
- [x] Plan the file structure for GAS project
- [x] Identify required script properties/configuration
- [x] Design error handling and logging strategy
- [x] Plan for rate limiting and API quotas

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Create main entry point script
- [x] Convert NPM API integration
- [x] Convert Google Sheets operations
- [x] Convert date utilities
- [x] Set up configuration management
- [x] Implement error handling and logging
- [x] Create setup instructions
- [x] Google Apps Script implementation complete: `google-apps-script-monthly-npm-downloads.js`
- [x] Setup guide complete: `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
- [x] Create test functions (included in script)
- [x] Document setup instructions
- [x] Create deployment guide
- [ ] User to test in their environment

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies to Replace
- axios → UrlFetchApp
- googleapis → SpreadsheetApp (native)
- date-fns → Native JS Date + Utilities.formatDate()
- dotenv → Script Properties

### API Integrations
- NPM Registry API (for package search and download stats)
- Google Sheets API (native in Apps Script)

### Authentication Changes
- From: Service account with JWT
- To: Script runs with owner's Google account permissions

## Tracking Progress

### Current Status: Phase 1 - Analysis
- [x] Examined nx-stat-publisher codebase structure
- [x] Identified main entry point: `src/main.ts`
- [x] Located monthly-npm-downloads implementation: `src/publishers/monthly-npm-downloads.ts`
- [x] Mapped dependencies: axios, date-fns, googleapis, yargs
- [x] Identified external APIs: NPM Registry, NPM Downloads API, Google Sheets API
- [x] Deep dive into implementation details for conversion
- [x] Analyzed monthly-npm-downloads.ts implementation
- [x] Reviewed Google Sheets integration (JWT auth, API calls)
- [x] Examined NPM API integration patterns
- [x] Confirmed suitability for Google Apps Script

### Notes
- CRITICAL: Keep track of implementation progress in this document
- Update TODO items as tasks are completed
- Document any blockers or changes to the plan

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional Google Apps Script that:
1. Fetches monthly NPM download statistics for all Nx packages
2. Updates a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the data
3. Can be scheduled to run weekly via time-based triggers
4. Requires no external hosting or maintenance
5. Includes clear setup and deployment instructions
