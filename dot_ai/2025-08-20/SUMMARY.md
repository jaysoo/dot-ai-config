### DOC-135: Fix H1 and Frontmatter Title Mismatch
- **Time**: 09:12 ET
- **Task Plan**: `tasks/doc-135-h1-title-fix.md`
- **Linear Issue**: [DOC-135](https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-135/style-main-title-and-h2-title-are-almost-not-distinguishable)

**What was done:**
- Analyzed all 349 mdoc files in astro-docs project
- Identified 7 files with h1 headings at the beginning of content
- Updated 1 file's frontmatter title ("Run Tasks" â†’ "Tasks") with sidebar label preservation
- Removed h1 headings from all 7 files to prevent duplication with Starlight's frontmatter title display

**Files Modified:**
1. features/run-tasks.mdoc (title updated + h1 removed)
2. features/maintain-typescript-monorepos.mdoc (h1 removed)
3. guides/Enforce Module Boundaries/tag-multiple-dimensions.mdoc (h1 removed)
4. guides/Nx Release/configure-custom-registries.mdoc (h1 removed)
5. guides/Nx Release/customize-conventional-commit-types.mdoc (h1 removed)
6. troubleshooting/resolve-circular-dependencies.mdoc (h1 removed)
7. troubleshooting/troubleshoot-cache-misses.mdoc (h1 removed)

**Result:** Better visual distinction between page titles (from frontmatter) and h2 section headers.
