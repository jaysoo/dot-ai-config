# Review Effy process

The review process has two issues to address: 

1. January reviews are too compressed given the January 31st bonus calculation deadline—consider shifting to November/December before the holiday break instead;
2. For the June/July mid-year review round, consider whether we need the full review questions or if a smaller-scope checkpoint would be more appropriate for a quick pulse check.
