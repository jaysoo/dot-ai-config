These decisions should have some inputs re: market feedback that we've heard from our prospects and existing customers. 

For example, I learned recently we are working on improving our flaky tasks, but I haven't heard any customers with feedback on this feature. I've heard a lot of feedback requesting additional analytics (e.g., access to our API).

The customer insights channel isn't the right medium for this - we should have a list of requested features/improvements/bugs/etc, with some notes on expected impact (sales et al can help with this), and then some cadence (e.g., quarterly) where this list is reviewed and prioritized for highest overall impact. For features that we can't get to, we'll at least have these in an organized backlog that everyone can see. ","The additional analytics (e.g., view of credit consumption, view of flaky tasks) are great additions that help provide some differentiation in our enterprise offering. The credit consumption is very welcome by customers like clickup with high compute spend. "
2/2/2026 13:56:38,3,2,3,4,5,"Eng typically has priority shifts that cause the feeling of over promise and underdeliver, when it's really ""I was working on this, but I'm told another issue is more pressing so hopefully I can get back to your original issue when I get time"" ","cutting scope on features so they don't forever sit being worked on. I'm 100% okay with us landing something narrow and specific as long as we're solving a known issue and improve things. once we get feedback from clients/customers then allows us to expand on that feature in more ways 

triaging issues. typically when I raise an issue it's mostly an ask for direction and making sure things make sense to even go down a given route which a quick triage can usually get me more threads to pull and provide better context to the eng team when I need their help next. "

(Graph Performance, DTE Hangs/Errors, etc.)","The CPU/Memory profiling is a massive help for enterprise customers using agents. On the other side, we don't have it for non-enterprise customers and the manual DTE experience is very cumbersome with no apparent interest in improving it in the near term."

2/4/2026 12:34:15,4,2,3,4,4,"It feels extremely difficult to get customer issues solved. If an issue isn't an urgent or blocking one, then the chance of it getting resolved while the problem is still relevant to the customer is very low. It seems almost pointless to create a customer issue with any priority other than Urgent or High. Even though the issue isn't a high priority, having to build and maintain a workaround is still work for the customer, and it still reflects negatively on Nx as a platform.","Engineering has had good focus, making sure to solve high-impact issues quickly. I also think that engineering communicates with stakeholders for features and issues very well."
