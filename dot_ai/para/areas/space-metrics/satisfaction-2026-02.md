### What's Working

**Autonomy (4.27)** -- The highest-scoring dimension. Only one person scored below 4. People feel trusted to approach work their own way.

**Learning & growth (4.27)** -- Also top-scoring, though one person scored a 2 here, suggesting not everyone feels they're developing. The other 10 all scored 4+.

**Genuine happiness exists on this team.** Several responses convey real satisfaction:

> "im actually quite happy with my day-to-day experience. I dont feel like i need to change or improve anything. I actually look forward to work on a Monday morning :D" (scored all 5s)

> "I don't have too many gripes, generally I think the team and our responsibilities are well-organized and designed."

**Leadership support is deeply valued by those who experience it:**

> "I've never had so much support like I do here at any other place I've worked at - as long as I make sure I communicate any concerns, the whole leadership and management team has always been incredible at supporting me which is by far the biggest contributor to my happiness here. I really appreciate it."

This person scored manager support a 5 but workload a 2 -- they feel supported even when stretched thin, which is a testament to the leadership culture.

**Expectations are generally clear (4.00)** -- Middling but not a crisis. Three people at 3 suggests room for improvement, but no one scored below 3.

### What's Not Working

**1. Workload is unsustainable for a significant chunk of the team**

4 of 11 scored a 2. That's 36% of the team signaling their workload isn't working. The theme is interrupts and lack of focus time:

> "the chance for more focused work, with less urgent interruptions"

> "I'm unsure, I'd say my day-to-day experience is not bad. I have autonomy to work, fairly clear goals, though some times not so clear competing high-priorities."

One person who scored workload a 2 but everything else 4-5 explicitly tied their happiness to a business metric rather than day-to-day work:

> "I'll just be a lot happier in general when the onboarding numbers improve."

This suggests some workload dissatisfaction may be about feeling like the work isn't paying off, not just volume.

**2. Recognition has a bimodal split**

Average of 3.55 hides a polarized distribution: two 1s and five 5s. Some people feel deeply recognized, others feel invisible. The 1s are the lowest scores in the entire survey on any dimension. One of them explained:

> "better people-management skills for team leads / proper managers would help me feel more seen and appreciated"

This person also scored manager support a 2, suggesting the recognition gap is tied to management quality/attention, not compensation or peer culture.

The other person who scored recognition a 1 also scored workload a 2, autonomy a 3 -- they appear broadly dissatisfied. Their only comment: "Clearer understanding of priorities."

**3. Priorities are muddy -- surfaced from multiple angles**

This came up in free-text from at least 4 respondents, each framing it differently:

On back-channel prioritization:

> "Clear communication channels between sales + Eng + marketing + CS. No back channel work assignment, no 'high priority' declaration without technical insight specifically around customer issues"

On lack of long-term direction:

> "Understanding longer-term goals for the team, since we don't fit into a product team it would be nice to have yearly project goals. Or if our team is too interrupt driven to have that, at least let's have aspirational goals."

On competing priorities:

> "more predictable priorities in terms of our release plan and/or roadmap (internal one for next release) could help even more to understand priorities better"

And one person simply: "Clearer understanding of priorities."

**4. Manager support is inconsistent (3.64)**

Two people scored 2 (the same ones who scored recognition lowest). Three scored 3. But also two scored 5. The issue isn't that management is bad across the board -- it's that some people feel well-supported and others don't. This could be a team-lead-specific issue rather than an org-wide one.

**5. Code review practices are a concern**

One person specifically called this out as the single thing to improve:

> "Moving away from over-reliance on automated PR reviews and asking for token 'stamps', and going back to more thorough peer code reviews for all or most changes."

This person scored recognition a 1 and autonomy a 3 -- the "token stamps" framing suggests they feel their work isn't being meaningfully engaged with by peers, which ties into the recognition gap.

**6. Desire for more structure**

One respondent who scored solidly (all 4s and 5s) asked for:

> "A bit more structure, time spent forming daily habits"

This is a lighter signal but suggests some people would benefit from more routine/cadence even in an autonomous environment.

### Score Correlations Worth Noting

- The two people who scored recognition at 1 both scored manager support at 3. The recognition gap may be a management attention issue.
- The person who scored learning/growth at 2 also scored expectations at 3 and manager support at 2 -- possibly someone who's plateauing without enough guidance.
- 4 of 11 scored workload at 2, but their other scores vary widely (some are very happy otherwise, others are broadly dissatisfied). Workload is hurting different people for different reasons.

## Stakeholder Survey

### Scores (1-5 scale)

| Question                     | Avg      | Distribution        | Signal       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Easy to collaborate with     | 4.25     | 3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5     | Strong       |
| Bug resolution time          | 3.75     | 3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5     | OK           |
| Understand what eng works on | 3.75     | 2,2,2,4,4,4,5,5     | OK (bimodal) |
| Features help me do my job   | 3.50     | 2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5     | Weak         |
| **Delivers on time**         | **2.88** | **2,2,2,2,2,4,4,5** | **Weakest**  |

### What's Working

**Collaboration is a clear strength (4.25).** Three people scored 5, and even the lowest scores were 3. Engineering is seen as approachable:

> "Engineering communicates with stakeholders for features and issues very well."

> "triaging issues. typically when I raise an issue it's mostly an ask for direction and making sure things make sense to even go down a given route which a quick triage can usually get me more threads to pull and provide better context to the eng team when I need their help next."

**Scope-cutting is appreciated.** Stakeholders explicitly value shipping narrow solutions over endless feature development:

> "cutting scope on features so they don't forever sit being worked on. I'm 100% okay with us landing something narrow and specific as long as we're solving a known issue and improve things. once we get feedback from clients/customers then allows us to expand on that feature in more ways"

**Recent deliverables are landing well.** Specific features were called out:

> "The additional analytics (e.g., view of credit consumption, view of flaky tasks) are great additions that help provide some differentiation in our enterprise offering. The credit consumption is very welcome by customers like clickup with high compute spend."

> "The CPU/Memory profiling is a massive help for enterprise customers using agents."

> "Produced more plan differentiation."

**Responsiveness to feedback is noticed:**

> "listening to my feedback" 😜

> "Engineering has had good focus, making sure to solve high-impact issues quickly."

**AI adoption for ticket velocity is visible externally:**

> "Employed AI to increase the ticket solving velocity."

**One person scored all 5s** and said: "Deliver consistently and improve the product." -- though they still asked for "Monthly or quarterly feedback sessions with Sales so we can share what we are hearing in the field."

### What's Not Working

**1. On-time delivery (2.88) -- the worst score in either survey**

5 of 8 stakeholders scored this a 2. This is a severe perception problem. The root cause, per stakeholders, is priority shifts, not engineering capability:

> "Eng typically has priority shifts that cause the feeling of over promise and underdeliver, when it's really 'I was working on this, but I'm told another issue is more pressing so hopefully I can get back to your original issue when I get time'"

This is notable because the stakeholder themselves understands the dynamic -- they don't blame engineering, they're describing a systemic issue.

**2. Non-urgent customer issues have no path to resolution**

This got the most detailed and frustrated free-text response in either survey:

> "It feels extremely difficult to get customer issues solved. If an issue isn't an urgent or blocking one, then the chance of it getting resolved while the problem is still relevant to the customer is very low. It seems almost pointless to create a customer issue with any priority other than Urgent or High. Even though the issue isn't a high priority, having to build and maintain a workaround is still work for the customer, and it still reflects negatively on Nx as a platform."

The key insight: even non-urgent issues carry cost (workaround maintenance, perception damage). The current triage treats non-urgent as non-costly, but stakeholders bear the cost.

**3. Roadmap isn't tied to customer demand or revenue**

One stakeholder gave a very detailed critique with a specific example:

> "I learned recently we are working on improving our flaky tasks, but I haven't heard any customers with feedback on this feature. I've heard a lot of feedback requesting additional analytics (e.g., access to our API)."

> "The customer insights channel isn't the right medium for this - we should have a list of requested features/improvements/bugs/etc, with some notes on expected impact (sales et al can help with this), and then some cadence (e.g., quarterly) where this list is reviewed and prioritized for highest overall impact. For features that we can't get to, we'll at least have these in an organized backlog that everyone can see."

This is a concrete proposal: a shared backlog with revenue impact notes, reviewed quarterly.

**4. No feature validation or success criteria**

> "Customer validation before development of a feature and goals set for each feature before release + follow through of if they hit that adoption goal or not."

Features ship without defined success metrics, and there's no loop to check if they actually got adopted.

**5. Visibility into engineering work is bimodal (3.75 avg, but 2,2,2 vs 4,4,5,5)**

Three stakeholders scored this a 2 -- they don't understand what engineering is working on or why. Five scored 4+. This suggests some stakeholders are in the loop and others are entirely out of it. The gap may correlate with how closely someone works with specific eng teams.

**6. Enterprise vs. non-enterprise experience gap**

> "The CPU/Memory profiling is a massive help for enterprise customers using agents. On the other side, we don't have it for non-enterprise customers and the manual DTE experience is very cumbersome with no apparent interest in improving it in the near term."

Stakeholders serving non-enterprise customers feel underserved.

**7. Proactive monitoring is lacking**

> "Proactive monitoring and fixing of issues our enterprise customers face. (Graph Performance, DTE Hangs/Errors, etc.)"

Rather than waiting for customer reports, this stakeholder wants engineering to detect and fix issues before they surface.

**8. Dogfooding suggestion**

One stakeholder suggested a different kind of improvement:

> "build more with Nx, not just Nx itself. Create demo apps, use AI agents to build side projects. That gives you an immediate feel what works and where things fail."

**9. Regressions**

> "Ensure new changes don't break/worsen the existing functionality."

## Actionable Takeaways

### High Priority (scored poorly + multiple mentions across both surveys)

1. **Fix the priority-setting process.** Both engineers ("competing high-priorities," "no back-channel work assignment") and stakeholders ("priority shifts cause over-promise/underdeliver") flagged this. The stakeholder proposal is concrete: a visible, prioritized backlog with revenue impact notes, reviewed quarterly. Sales/CS provide demand signal; eng provides feasibility and effort. This is the single highest-leverage fix because it cascades into workload, on-time delivery, and feature relevance.

2. **Create a customer issue SLA or triage tier.** Non-urgent issues dying on the vine is a stakeholder trust problem. Even if capacity doesn't change, two things would help: (a) visibility into when/whether something will get addressed, and (b) acknowledging that even non-urgent issues carry cost to stakeholders maintaining workarounds.

3. **Address workload sustainability.** 4/11 engineers at a 2 (36%). The interrupt-driven nature combined with unclear priorities is compounding -- people can't protect focus time when priorities shift constantly. Fixing #1 would help here, but also consider whether dedicated focus time or interrupt rotation could reduce the burden.

### Medium Priority (clear signal, fewer mentions)

4. **Recognition and management attention gap.** Two 1s on recognition in a team of 11 is notable. Both correlate with lower manager support scores. This is likely a team-lead coaching item -- some leads are making people feel seen, others aren't. The ask is explicit: "better people-management skills for team leads."

5. **Establish a lightweight feature validation loop.** Stakeholders want: (a) pre-build customer validation ("has anyone actually asked for this?"), (b) post-ship adoption tracking ("did they use it?"). The flaky tasks vs. analytics API example is a concrete case where engineering invested in something without confirmed customer demand while a frequently-requested feature waited.

6. **Quarterly Sales-Eng feedback sessions.** Multiple stakeholders asked for structured input on what they're hearing in the field. Even the person who scored all 5s asked for this. Low cost, directly feeds into #1.

7. **Proactive monitoring for enterprise customers.** Specific asks around Graph Performance and DTE Hangs/Errors. Instead of waiting for customer reports, detect and fix proactively.

### Low Priority / Monitor

- **Code review quality** -- One mention, but the "token stamps" framing connects to the recognition gap. Worth watching for pattern.
- **Long-term team goals** -- Valid ask from a team that "doesn't fit into a product team." Aspirational goals at minimum. Easier to address once priorities are clearer (#1).
- **Non-enterprise experience** -- Strategic decision about resource allocation, not a quick fix. But stakeholders serving that segment feel underserved.
- **Regressions** -- One mention of ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality. Monitor.
- **Dogfooding** -- "Build more with Nx, not just Nx itself" is a cultural suggestion worth considering.
- **Learning/growth outlier** -- One person scored 2 (while avg was 4.27). Combined with low manager support and expectations scores, this may be someone who needs a growth conversation.

### Through-Line

The common thread across both surveys is **priority management**: engineers feel whipsawed by shifting priorities, stakeholders feel let down on timelines, and there's no shared artifact (a prioritized backlog with revenue/demand context) that both sides trust. That's the highest-leverage fix, and a stakeholder has already proposed the shape of the solution.

Secondary theme: **the team has genuine strengths** (autonomy, collaboration, scope-cutting, leadership support) that should be preserved, not eroded by process changes. Any fix to priorities should add clarity without removing the autonomy people value.
