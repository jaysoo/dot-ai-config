# Nx Platform Intelligence — Week 09, 2026

_Generated: 2026-02-27_
_Scans run: competitors, frameworks, runtimes, ai-landscape, community, api-surface, dependencies (abbreviated), supply-chain (abbreviated)_
_Scans failed: None (2 abbreviated due to npm API rate limits)_

## TL;DR — What's New This Week

- **[Frameworks]** Vite 8 will replace esbuild+Rollup with Rolldown — fundamental change for @nx/vite. Start compatibility testing now.
- **[Frameworks]** Rspack 2.0 shipped as pure ESM, drops Node 18. @nx/rspack needs ESM migration work.
- **[Competitors]** Cursor Cloud Agents producing merge-ready PRs with video demos (35% of internal Cursor PRs). Sets new UX bar for AI-CI output.
- **[Competitors]** GitHub Agentic Workflows in tech preview — automated repository tasks via coding agents in GitHub Actions. Directly competitive with Nx Cloud CI intelligence.
- **[Community]** Nx core hit **34M downloads/month** (+64% YoY). @nx/vite closing in on @nx/webpack. @nx/rspack growing rapidly.
- **[Community]** Module Federation remains the most bug-dense area (multiple open issues). **60% of February issues (47/78) are unresponded** — triage capacity under pressure.
- **[API Surface]** 4 high-severity findings: stale deprecation timelines ("removed in v20/v22" but still present in v22.5), and no docs for `set-up-ai-agents` generator.
- **[AI Landscape]** Agent Skills spec becoming cross-platform standard (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Verdent). MCP donated to Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation.
- **[Runtimes]** Node 20 EOL on April 30, 2026. Plan minimum version bump and migration guidance.

## Action Required

### This Week

1. **Triage unresponded issues** — 47 issues with 0 comments in February; at minimum, triage the ones with reactions

### Soon (This Month)

4. **Rspack 2.0 ESM migration** — @nx/rspack needs to work with pure ESM Rspack
5. **Vite 8 compatibility planning** — Rolldown replacing esbuild+Rollup; test @nx/vite early
6. **Node 20 EOL messaging** — April 30 deadline approaching; blog post + migration guide
7. **Fix stale deprecation timelines** — `@nx/angular:move`, `@nx/angular:ngrx` say "removed in v22" but are in v22.5; `TaskHasher` says "removed in v20"
8. **Add docs for `set-up-ai-agents` generator** — Flagship Nx 22 feature has no API reference page
9. **Update copy-webpack-plugin pin** — #34632 keeping fast-glob in tree unnecessarily

### Watching

10. **GitHub Agentic Workflows** — Tech preview, directly competitive with Nx Cloud CI intelligence
11. **Cursor Cloud Agents** — 35% internal PR authorship rate; new UX bar for merge-ready artifacts
12. **Module Federation bug density** — Multiple open issues in Feb; most complex/fragile surface area
13. **@phenomnomnominal/tsquery maintenance** — Single maintainer, used by 11 @nx/\* packages
14. **Bun lockfile parsing** — oven-sh/bun#16252 affects Nx lockfile parsing

## Scan Summaries

### Dependencies

Abbreviated scan due to npm API rate limits. 2 outdated pins identified (copy-webpack-plugin #34632, @aws-sdk #34281) and 3 watch-list single-maintainer deps (@phenomnomnominal/tsquery, enquirer, node-machine-id). minimatch CVE (#34507) was already patched. Full audit with `pnpm install && npm audit` recommended.

### Supply Chain Security

OIDC trusted publishing is enabled (`id-token: write`). Release script integrity checks are in place for PR releases. Partial scan only — npm org membership, typosquat check, and full npm audit need manual follow-up. Ocean/nx-cloud publish pipeline was not audited (private repo).
[Full report](../supply-chain-security/2026-02.md)

### API Surface

4 high-severity findings: two Angular generators with stale "removed in v22" deprecation (still present in v22.5), TaskHasher overloads with stale "removed in v20" deprecation, and no documentation page for the `set-up-ai-agents` generator. 7 medium findings include stale setup-tailwind deprecation timelines in docs, removed APIs (defaultTasksRunner, RemoteCache) still exported and documented, and deprecated types without doc badges.
[Full report](../api-surface-audit/2026-02.md)

### Community Sentiment

Nx core downloads surging: 34M/month (+64% YoY). ESLint 10 compat was the top pain point but is now resolved (#34415 closed Feb 26). Module Federation is the most bug-dense area. @nx/vite approaching @nx/webpack in downloads — the bundler shift is happening. @nx/rspack growing rapidly. 60% of February issues are unresponded (47/78), indicating triage pressure. Top long-standing feature requests: tsconfig generation (#4508, 71 reactions, 5 years), type check command (#3664, 69 reactions, 5.5 years).

### Competitors

Turborepo v2.8 added Agent Skills support and performance improvements (libgit2→gix-index). Cursor launched Cloud Agents producing merge-ready PRs (35% internal PR authorship). GitHub Copilot CLI went GA and Agentic Workflows entered tech preview. Moon 2.0 shipped WASM plugin system. Nx's Self-Healing CI remains the only tool at the remediation stage (vs diagnosis-only competitors).

### Frameworks & Bundlers

Four critical/high compatibility risks: Vite 8 (Rolldown replaces esbuild+Rollup), Next.js 16 (Turbopack default), Angular 21 (Vitest default test runner), Rspack 2.0 (pure ESM, drops Node 18). The bundler landscape is shifting rapidly — @nx/vite and @nx/rspack gaining while @nx/webpack declines. React Foundation governance transfer has no immediate Nx impact.

### Runtimes (Node.js, Bun, Deno)

Node 20 EOL April 30, 2026 — plan minimum version bump. Bun's bun.lock format has parsing issues with Nx (oven-sh/bun#16252). Deno 2.7 shipped Temporal API as stable. TC39 `using` keyword reached Stage 4. Node 24.13.1 had security patches.

### AI Dev Tools Landscape

Every major AI coding tool now ships multi-agent orchestration with worktree isolation. Agent Skills spec becoming cross-platform standard (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Verdent). MCP donated to Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation. GitHub Agentic Workflows is the most direct competitor to Nx Cloud's CI intelligence. Claude Code Security found 500+ zero-days — security scanning in CI is an adjacent opportunity. Nx's "skills for knowledge, MCP for connectivity" strategy aligns with where the ecosystem landed.
