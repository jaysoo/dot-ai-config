## File Structure

Each team folder contains:
- `README.md` - Meeting tracker with topics, action items, and notes

### Section Order

1. **Topics for Next Meeting** - Items to discuss in the upcoming sync
2. **Upcoming Sync** - Accumulated notes/context between meetings (moved into today's notes when sync happens)
3. **Active Accounts** (optional) - Customer/account status tables
4. **Action Items** - Grouped by date, with checkboxes
5. **Meeting Notes** - Dated entries in reverse chronological order

## Usage

### Between syncs:
- Add topics to "Topics for Next Meeting" as they come up
- Add detailed context/notes to "Upcoming Sync" section

### After each sync:
1. **Move "Upcoming Sync" content** into today's dated meeting notes (integrate with discussion)
2. **Clear "Upcoming Sync"** section (keep the header, remove content)
3. Add dated entry under "Meeting Notes"
4. Update action items (add new, mark completed)
5. Clear "Topics for Next Meeting" items that were discussed

**Important**: Never delete the "Upcoming Sync" section - just clear its content after moving to today's notes.
