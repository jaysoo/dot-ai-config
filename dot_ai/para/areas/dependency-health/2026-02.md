## Key Dependencies by Risk Profile

### Healthy (Active, Recent Publishes)
- **tslib** — Microsoft-maintained, very active
- **semver** — npm-maintained, active
- **yargs** / **yargs-parser** — Active maintenance
- **picocolors** — Active (modern chalk alternative)

- **axios** — Active
- **webpack** — Active (though shifting to maintenance mode)

- **ora** — Used by nx, create-nx-workspace, @nx/angular-rspack. Check maintenance status
- **node-machine-id** — Used by nx core. Single-purpose package, check for activity

## Publishing Workflow Review

From `/tmp/nx-scan-1772238264/.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
- **OIDC**: Uses `id-token: write` permission (trusted publishing)
- **Branch protection**: Runs on schedule (master), release events, and workflow_dispatch
- **Release script integrity**: PR releases verify that `nx-release.ts` and `publish-resolve-data.js` haven't been modified vs master
- **Multi-platform builds**: Native binaries built on macOS, Windows, Linux (GNU + musl), ARM

## Manual Checks Needed
- Full npm audit of the nx repo (requires `pnpm install`)
- Detailed last-publish dates for all 120+ deps
- @phenomnomnominal/tsquery maintenance status (critical single-maintainer dep)
- enquirer maintenance status
- node-machine-id maintenance status
