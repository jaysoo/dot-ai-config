# AI Development Tools Landscape — February 2026

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every major AI coding tool now ships multi-agent orchestration with worktree isolation** — Codex app (macOS), Cursor Cloud Agents, and Claude Code all adopted git worktrees for parallel agent work. This validates Nx's bet on workspace-aware tooling.

2. **The Agent Skills spec is becoming a cross-platform standard.** Originated by Anthropic (Dec 2025), adopted by Codex CLI, Cursor, and Verdent. Nx's shift from MCP tools to skills (`SKILL.md` files) is directionally correct.

3. **MCP is institutionalized.** Donated to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (co-founded by Anthropic, Block, OpenAI; supported by Google, Microsoft, AWS). 10,000+ public servers, 7M downloads/month.

4. **AI-powered CI is the new battleground.** GitHub Agentic Workflows (tech preview), Cursor Cloud Agents producing merge-ready PRs, and Codex's long-horizon autonomous runs all converge on CI. Nx Self-Healing CI's >50% useful fix rate is a genuine competitive moat.

5. **Claude Code Security launched** — Anthropic found 500+ zero-days in open-source codebases using Claude Opus 4.6. Security scanning in CI pipelines is an adjacent opportunity for Nx Cloud.

## MCP Ecosystem

- **Spec version**: 2025-11-25 (stable)
- **Governance**: Donated to Agentic AI Foundation under Linux Foundation
- **Scale**: 10,000+ active public MCP servers, ~7M server downloads/month
- **Enterprise SaaS adoption**: Atlassian, Figma, Asana, Salesforce, Cloudflare, New Relic, Auth0
- **IDE/Tool adoption**: ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, VS Code, Microsoft Copilot

## AI Coding Tools

### Claude Code
- Claude Opus 4.6 released
- Claude Code Security (limited research preview): 500+ zero-days found
- Worktree isolation (`--worktree` / `-w` flag)
- Background tasks, Remote Control (mobile app)

### GitHub Copilot
- **Copilot CLI GA** (Feb 25): Terminal-native agentic coding agent
- **Agentic Workflows** (tech preview, Feb 13): Automated repository workflows in GitHub Actions
- Multi-model support: Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, Gemini 3 Pro

### Cursor
- **v2.5** (Feb 17): Plugin marketplace, async subagents, sandbox network controls
- **Cloud Agents** (Feb 24): Autonomous agents on isolated VMs, merge-ready PRs
- 35% of internal Cursor PRs authored by cloud agents

### OpenAI Codex
- **macOS app** (Feb 2): Multi-agent threads, git worktree support
- **GPT-5.2-Codex**: Optimized for agentic coding, migrations, refactors

### Google Jules
- Jules Tools CLI, Jules API, Critic feature
- Gemini 3 integration

## Implications for Nx

### Validate (On Track)
- Skills over MCP for knowledge — industry direction matches
- Self-Healing CI — competitors still at diagnosis, Nx at remediation
- Monorepo-aware AI — agents need project graph, ownership, task metadata

### Challenge (Risks)
- GitHub Agentic Workflows could subsume some Nx Cloud AI-CI value
- 13.4% of public marketplace skills have critical security issues (Snyk audit)
- Cursor Cloud Agents set new UX bar for merge-ready PRs

### Opportunity
- Nx Skills Marketplace (curated, security-vetted monorepo skills)
- Security scanning in Nx Cloud CI (adjacent to Self-Healing)
- Worktree-aware workspace init (`nx worktree-init`)
- Nx generators as agent skills (distribution channel)
