# Supply Chain Security — February 2026

_Last updated: 2026-02-27_

## Status: Partial Scan (npm API rate-limited)

## Summary
- npm audit: Deferred (requires full pnpm install)
- Publishing: OIDC trusted publishing enabled
- Provenance: id-token: write in publish workflow
- Typosquat check: Deferred

## Publishing Security

### Nx CLI (nrwl/nx)
- **Trusted publishing (OIDC)**: Yes — `id-token: write` in publish.yml
- **Release script integrity check**: Yes — PR releases verify scripts match master
- **Branch protection**: Publishes from master (schedule), release events, or approved workflow_dispatch
- **Environment protection**: Workflow runs only when `github.repository_owner == 'nrwl'`
- **Multi-platform native builds**: macOS (x86+ARM), Windows, Linux GNU, Linux musl, ARM Linux

### Nx Cloud (nrwl/nx-cloud)
- **Status**: Private repo — not audited in this scan
- **Action needed**: Manual review of ocean's publish pipeline

## Known Security Issues

### CVE-2026-26996 — minimatch
- Filed as GitHub issue #34507
- Affects nx core and multiple @nx/* packages
- Check if patched version is in use

### copy-webpack-plugin pin
- #34632 — outdated pin keeps fast-glob (potential supply chain vector) in dependency tree
- Affects @nx/webpack, @nx/next

## Org Access
- npm org membership check requires authentication
- **Manual check needed**: Verify all npm org members still on team, 2FA enabled

## Recommendations

1. **Run full npm audit** after pnpm install on the nx repo
2. **Check npm org membership** for @nrwl and @nx scopes
3. **Verify ocean publish pipeline** has same security posture as nx
4. **Update minimatch** to address CVE-2026-26996
5. **Update copy-webpack-plugin** to drop fast-glob from tree

## Manual Checks Needed
- Full npm audit (production + dev)
- npm org member list and 2FA status
- Ocean/nx-cloud publish workflow review
- Typosquat scan for @nx/*, @nrwl/*, nx-* packages
- Dependency provenance check (top 20 critical deps)
