# Framework & Bundler Ecosystem — February 2026

## Critical Compatibility Risks

### Vite 8 (CRITICAL)
- **Rolldown replaces esbuild + Rollup** as the bundler engine
- This is a fundamental architecture change that will affect @nx/vite
- Nx plugin needs testing and likely updates for Rolldown compatibility
- Timeline: Vite 8 beta expected Q1 2026

### Next.js 16 (CRITICAL)
- **Turbopack becomes default bundler** (replaces Webpack)
- @nx/next build pipeline may need significant changes
- Turbopack has different plugin/loader model than Webpack
- **Status: Stable** — v16.1.6 on npm (published ~1 month ago)

### Angular 21 (HIGH)
- **Vitest becomes default test runner** (replaces Karma/Jest)
- @nx/angular test configuration needs to support Vitest as default
- Existing Jest configs should still work but won't be the default path
- Timeline: Angular 21 developer preview

### Rspack 2.0 (HIGH)
- **Pure ESM** — drops CommonJS support
- **Drops Node.js 18** support
- @nx/rspack plugin needs ESM migration and Node 18 compatibility check
- Timeline: Rspack 2.0 released

## Framework Updates

### React
- React Foundation transfer (governance change)
- No breaking changes for @nx/react

### Vue 3.6
- Vapor mode beta (compile-time reactivity)
- No immediate Nx impact

### Svelte
- Continued iteration, SvelteKit stable
- @nx/svelte community plugin unaffected

## Bundler Landscape

| Bundler | Status | Nx Plugin |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Webpack | Stable, maintenance mode | @nx/webpack (6.6M downloads) |
| Vite | v8 major change coming | @nx/vite (5.6M downloads) |
| Rspack | v2.0 released (ESM-only) | @nx/rspack (2.6M downloads) |
| Turbopack | Default in Next.js 16 | Via @nx/next |
| esbuild | Being replaced in Vite 8 | Via @nx/vite |

## Action Items

1. **Vite 8 compatibility testing** — Start early, Rolldown is a fundamental change
2. **Rspack 2.0 ESM migration** — @nx/rspack needs to be pure ESM compatible
3. **Angular 21 Vitest support** — Ensure @nx/angular works with Vitest as default
4. **Next.js 16 Turbopack** — Test @nx/next with Turbopack default
