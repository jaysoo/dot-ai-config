# Promotions

Conduct promotion evaluations twice yearly to assess team members' readiness for advancement. Current pending promotions to track: Altan (L5C → L6), Patrick (L4C → L5), Chau (to L5), Max (to L5), and Leo (to L5). Review each candidate's performance, scope of impact, and alignment with level expectations before the next evaluation cycle.
