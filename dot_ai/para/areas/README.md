# Areas

Ongoing responsibilities requiring regular attention. Unlike projects, areas have no end date.

## Purpose

Areas represent continuous aspects of work that need maintenance:
- Personnel management and 1:1s
- Team syncs and coordination
- Engineering productivity tracking

## Current Areas

| Area | Folder | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| AI Trends | `ai-trends/` | AI/LLM developments, patterns, and learnings |
| Personnel | `personnel/` | Team member notes for 1:1s and relationships |
| Syncs | `syncs/` | Recurring team meeting notes |
| Productivity | `productivity/` | Engineering productivity metrics and tracking |

## Adding New Areas

1. Create a new folder: `areas/[area-name]/`
2. Add `README.md` describing the area's purpose
3. Update this README with the new area
