# Runtime Tracking — February 2026

_Last updated: 2026-02-27_
_Sources: Official release notes, GitHub, TC39_

## Action Required

### Node.js 20 EOL — April 30, 2026 (HIGH)
- Node 20 reaches End of Life on April 30, 2026
- Nx should update minimum supported Node version for next major
- Users on Node 20 need migration path guidance
- Node 22 is current LTS (until April 2027)

### Bun bun.lock Parsing Broken for Nx (HIGH)
- Bun's lockfile format (`bun.lock`) has parsing issues with Nx
- Related to Bun outputting malformed Yarn-format lockfiles
- GitHub issue: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/16252
- Workaround: Use `--yarn` flag or switch to package-lock.json
- Affects @nx/js lockfile parsing, `nx release` publish, dependency graph

## Runtime Updates

### Node.js
- **Node 24.13.1**: Security patches released
- **Node 22 LTS**: Current recommended version
- **Node 20**: Approaching EOL (April 30, 2026)

### Bun
- Continued iteration on bun.lock format
- Growing adoption (npm downloads of bun increasing)
- Lockfile compatibility remains the primary Nx pain point

### Deno
- **Deno 2.7**: Temporal API now stable
- Continued Node.js compatibility improvements
- Limited Nx integration demand

## TC39 Proposals

### `using` Keyword — Stage 4
- Explicit Resource Management (`using` / `await using`)
- Now Stage 4 (ready for inclusion in ECMAScript)
- Relevant for Nx daemon, file handles, database connections
- TypeScript already supports this syntax

### Other Notable Proposals
- Temporal API (Stage 3, stable in Deno 2.7)
- Iterator helpers (shipped in Node 22+)

## Recommendations

1. **Plan Node 20 EOL messaging** — Blog post, migration guide, minimum version bump
2. **Track Bun lockfile fix** — Monitor oven-sh/bun#16252 for resolution
3. **Consider `using` keyword** in new Nx internal code for resource cleanup
