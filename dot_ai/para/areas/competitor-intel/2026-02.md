## Key Highlights

### Turborepo
- **v2.8**: Agent Skills support, performance improvements (libgit2 replaced with gix-index for faster git hashing)
- Continuing to invest in Rust-based performance
- Remote caching v2 with content-addressable storage is a positioning threat to Nx Cloud

### Moon
- **v2.0**: WASM-based plugin system, significant architecture change
- Moving toward language-agnostic monorepo tooling via WASM extensions
- Smaller community but technically innovative

### Bazel
- **v9.0 LTS**: Long-term support release
- Enterprise adoption remains strong in large Java/C++ shops
- Not a direct Nx competitor for JS/TS ecosystems

### Gradle
- **v9.4-RC1**: Release candidate
- JVM ecosystem crossover with Nx's Gradle plugin
- Relevant for Nx's JVM story

### Pants
- **v2.31.0**: Continued iteration
- Python/Go focused, limited JS/TS overlap
- Not a direct competitor

## Download Trends

Turborepo remains the primary competitor in the JS/TS monorepo space. Nx's 34M monthly downloads vs Turborepo's growth trajectory warrants continued monitoring.

## Nx Positioning

- Nx's broader plugin ecosystem (React, Angular, Next, Vite, Rspack, etc.) remains a key differentiator
- Self-Healing CI and AI features have no Turborepo equivalent yet
- Turborepo's Agent Skills adoption signals convergence on the skills spec standard
