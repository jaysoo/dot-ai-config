- **Goals:** Focus on features that generate enterprise revenue
- **Strengths:** Strategic thinking, willing to prioritize ruthlessly

## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming Topics
- **Claude Plugin for Nx Repo:** Discuss creating a plugin to share skills, agents, etc. with the team
- **PR Review Goals 2026:** TTM/TTFR under 24 hours (ideally under 12 hours), encourage AI-assisted PR reviews for prioritization and summaries


#### Effy Reviews

Strengths:

- Good orchestrator for the CLI team
- Quick to understand new projects
- Proactive in finding issues and making sure that they are resolved
- Runs meetings efficiently and keeps team on track
- Eager to help and jump on calls

Most valuable contribution:

- Leading CLI team
- Maven, Kotlin graph analyzer -- using AI to dig through Maven code to figure out integration points

Improvements:

- Decisions for cycle work is not clearly communicated, and no feedback on proposals
- More clearly communicate rationale behind decisions

Action items:

- Team-wide planning sessions, review previous proposals with the team

#### Concerns about communication style

**Sales Pipeline Discussion - Concern from Sales Team:**

Jeff: sometimes come off as "I know better, therefore I am going to challenge this decision/process etc."

Jason's questioning during Madeline's sales update caused concern/confusion among Sales folks. Key exchange:

- **Jason:** "There seems to be a lot of opportunities.. but are we going to act on all 50 of them? In particular there's 37 opportunities coming from uptiering people.. are they all active?"
- **Madeline:** Clarified that every open opportunity is actively being worked with next steps, dates, descriptions, and notes. Process includes accountability during 1:1s, sales team meetings, forecasting. Opportunities not being worked are moved to closed lost.
- **Jason follow-up:** "Yeah, they all seem like differing levels of revenue but it's not clear how much effort we're putting forth to each of them.. like 899k / 37 the average is probably 30k? But the partner referrals is 600k in 4 opportunities so an average of 150k? Shouldn't more effort be put forth for those deals?"
- **Madeline:** "This is 100% taken into consideration. Please put time on my calendar so I can build more trust into the process of pipeline management"

**Takeaway:** The questioning came across as skepticism about whether Sales is prioritizing correctly. This reinforces the earlier topic about perception - his analytical approach can land as challenging the team's competence.

### 2026-01-07

**Maven Plugin Paywall Discussion:**
- Strong internal pushback: Colum against it, James raised issues at all hands, general team opposed
- Victor wants to proceed despite feedback - no clear path to revenue generation identified
- Jason's perspective: feels like "extreme measure" due to resource constraints, concerned about underlying company health implications, not motivated by growth but by survival/funding needs

**Strategic Concerns & Alternative Approach:**
- Current approach lacks clarity on: where to draw paid vs free line, how Maven gating generates enterprise revenue, differentiation from AI-powered features (V+)
- Jason's proposed focus shift: prioritize existing revenue features (CPU tracking, I/O tracing), gate new Maven features that integrate with Cloud, develop pipeline of paid features instead of retroactive gating

**Team Capacity & Priorities:**
- Jason committed to focusing on revenue-generating features, willing to let maintenance slide (e.g., delay Prettier V3 support)
- Week priorities: catching up on FE reviews, tracing coordination with Altan, UI work with Nicole can wait

**Upcoming Deliverables:**
- Jason attending Zach's CLI/Nx 22.3 livestream instead of Jack - focus on shipped features, not roadmap; can mention beta features like full screen
- Platform roadmap: Victor writing comprehensive platform roadmap, team roadmap publication delayed until Victor's complete

**Action Items:**
- Jack: Discuss Maven decision with Victor this week - push for clarity on revenue path or abandon gating
- Jason: Focus on revenue-generating features
- Jason: Coordinate with Altan on tracing work
- Colum: Reviewing outdated plugins for deprecation decisions
