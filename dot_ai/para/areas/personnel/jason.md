## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming Topics
- **PR Review Goals 2026:** TTM/TTFR under 24 hours (ideally under 12 hours), encourage AI-assisted PR reviews for prioritization and summaries

### 2026-01-07

**Maven Plugin Paywall Discussion:**
- Strong internal pushback: Colum against it, James raised issues at all hands, general team opposed
- Victor wants to proceed despite feedback - no clear path to revenue generation identified
- Jason's perspective: feels like "extreme measure" due to resource constraints, concerned about underlying company health implications, not motivated by growth but by survival/funding needs

**Strategic Concerns & Alternative Approach:**
- Current approach lacks clarity on: where to draw paid vs free line, how Maven gating generates enterprise revenue, differentiation from AI-powered features (V+)
- Jason's proposed focus shift: prioritize existing revenue features (CPU tracking, I/O tracing), gate new Maven features that integrate with Cloud, develop pipeline of paid features instead of retroactive gating

**Team Capacity & Priorities:**
- Jason committed to focusing on revenue-generating features, willing to let maintenance slide (e.g., delay Prettier V3 support)
- Week priorities: catching up on FE reviews, tracing coordination with Altan, UI work with Nicole can wait

**Upcoming Deliverables:**
- Jason attending Zach's CLI/Nx 22.3 livestream instead of Jack - focus on shipped features, not roadmap; can mention beta features like full screen
- Platform roadmap: Victor writing comprehensive platform roadmap, team roadmap publication delayed until Victor's complete

**Action Items:**
- Jack: Discuss Maven decision with Victor this week - push for clarity on revenue path or abandon gating
- Jason: Focus on revenue-generating features
- Jason: Coordinate with Altan on tracing work
- Colum: Reviewing outdated plugins for deprecation decisions
