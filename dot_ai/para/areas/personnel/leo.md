## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-26

**Weather & Travel**
- Returned from first-ever client onsite in Lithuania (minus 20°C)

**Swedbank Onsite Review**
- First client onsite with Miro in Lithuania went well overall
- Technical work completed:
  - Assignment rules blocked by client's MongoDB access issues
  - Performance issues found in graph, need new version releases
  - Angular build performance review - client already using ES build
  - Isolated modules disabled due to type issues client needs to resolve
- Cache hit ratio problems traced to Renovate merging multiple PRs daily
  - Bank security requires separate dependency PRs
  - Suggested timing PR merges to reduce cache invalidation impact
- Annual onsite format: client presents priorities, team reviews and improves

**Performance Review & Career Development**
- 360 review feedback useful, similar to previous rounds
- L5 assessment challenges:
  - Some criteria outdated for current team size (supervising others, large efforts)
  - Need clearer management visibility on career progression gaps
- Project delivery improvements needed:
  - Better tracking from completion to customer value realization
  - Many features finished but not properly followed up or polished
  - Quick wins approach: get customer feedback within 1-2 weeks vs waiting months
- Planning process feedback:
  - Top-down planning necessary for company alignment
  - Need separate backlog review meetings to surface forgotten projects
  - Angular minor releases sometimes disrupt planned work (3 days unplanned this cycle)
  - Suggests creating projects for minor releases vs miscellaneous tasks

**AI Automation Initiatives**
- Experimenting with AI skills for Angular upgrade workflow during cooldown week
  - Automating release notes review and commit analysis
  - Building reusable tools for team beyond just Leo and Colin
- Custom Claude plugin for NX repo discussed - no technical blocker, just needs someone to start
- Future AI migration system concept:
  - Enterprise offering for automatic PR-based upgrades
  - Multi-team effort planned for this year
  - Expressed strong interest in participating in AI efforts for career development
