**Effy Review Process Feedback**

1. **STOP** - questions that don't yield valuable info:
   - "What is the most valuable contribution they have made to the company during the last six months?" — This one often gets answered by way of the other questions like "How well have they demonstrated the skills/knowledge required for their role/level?"

2. **CONTINUE** - questions that do yield valuable info:
   - "How often do they take the initiative in identifying and solving problems (irrespective of their role/level)?" — Heidi's favorite question because it aids in helpful feedback on what they're doing well or growth opportunities. It's a clear indicator no matter the role if they're on the path to promotion or need coaching.
   - "What's one thing they could do to increase their impact?" — Shows growth opportunity, applies to everyone

3. **START** - suggestions:
   - A lot of the questions are about how people perform for their level; for engineers it's easier because there's documentation
   - Helpful for non-eng teams for team leads to put something together that explains what's expected of their team
   - Example: Juri reviewed Caitlin but said a few times he wasn't sure what her role entailed
   - Philip's role has shifted a bit in the last few years so people expected him to be doing things that weren't his priorities anymore
   - Heidi could write up a bulleted list of what a Marketing Manager is responsible for and people could reference that before they review Caitlin moving forward
