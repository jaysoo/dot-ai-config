## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-06

**Topic:** DPE/Engineering Communication Gap

**Discussion:**

Bridging the gap between what the engineering team has done (particularly bug fixes) and what Customer Success is waiting for - either for SaaS customers via support email or from different customers.

**Key Metric to Track:**
- Time from initial customer/user contact to resolution (not just fix + deploy, but the full loop back to customer)
- Need to develop more metrics to show we're moving in the right direction

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Joe:** Look into how to get the stat from initial email to resolution email
- [ ] **Jack:** Follow up with Steven and Caleb in 1:1s for their ideas on bridging this gap
- [ ] Circle back with Joe next week on the metric tracking

**Follow-ups for Steven & Caleb:**
- What are their ideas for improving visibility between engineering and Customer Success?
- How can we better communicate when bug fixes are deployed?
- Which versions fixed specific bugs (support email context)
