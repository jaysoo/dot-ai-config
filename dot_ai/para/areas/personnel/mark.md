## Professional

- **Current Focus:** BitBucket self-healing integration, workspace dashboard onboarding
- **Goals:** Path to L5 - requires increased ownership initiative, pushing ideas forward, knowledge sharing
- **Strengths:** VCS integration SME (GitHub, Azure, GitLab, BitBucket), technical problem identification
- **Manager:** Transitioning to John (biweekly), Mark every 6 weeks

## Performance Review Prep (Delivered 2026-01-22)

1) Strengths

- Technically strong: Handles complex VCS integration work (GitHub, Azure, GitLab)
- Go-to person for VCS integrations: Established domain expertise
- Reliable executor: Delivers good quality work when given clear direction
- Collaborates well on execution: Works with team on fixes, responds to feedback, helps debug client issues
- Easy to work with: Open to feedback, follows guidance, personable
- Thinks about product: Not just closing tickets - considers how to make the product better

2) Areas to Improve

- Lacks proactive initiative: Doesn't often identify new problems or suggest alternative solutions; issues in shipped work found by others
- Needs more testing rigor: Work is good but needs "more testing around the edges"
- Doesn't share knowledge: Built complex VCS integrations but doesn't document gotchas or learnings; team loses time debugging "black boxes"
- Doesn't speak up: Has good ideas but doesn't voice disagreement on technical/UI decisions
- Requires direction: Sometimes needs guidance on what to do next
- Work is isolated: Rarely reviews others' PRs; limited cross-company communication

3) Action Items

1. Document learnings: Record Looms explaining how integrations work and why
2. Take ownership post-merge: Proactively find and resolve issues in shipped work before others discover them
3. Increase initiative: Come up with own solutions and push ideas earlier rather than waiting for direction
4. Speak up more: Voice opinions when disagreeing with technical/UI decisions

4) Most Valuable Contributions

- VCS integration work: GitHub permissions fixes, Azure support, GitLab integration
- Self-healing CI features with agent logging and confidence scoring
- Self-healing PR improvements
- New onboarding flow
- Client fixes (ClickUp, Mailchimp)
- Shipped important pieces for Red Panda across frontend and Kotlin stack

5) Other Notes

- There is a path to higher L4 bands, and a path to L5 that requires more proactive ownership

## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-22

**Performance Review Feedback:**
- Strong appreciation for VCS integration expertise - recognized as SME and go-to person
- Technical expertise and problem identification skills acknowledged
- Gap: Less proactive knowledge sharing - team wants more visibility into technical insights
- Need to flag trade-offs, design issues, or edge cases when others work on areas he's touched
- Testing: Edge cases occasionally caught in production vs testing phase

**Growth Path:**
- Current performance solid at L4 level
- Path to L5 requires increased ownership initiative
- Less about taking John's responsibilities, more about owning smaller domains
- Need to push ideas forward vs just discussing them
- Knowledge sharing bottleneck - consider pairing with James/John/Chow on VCS bugs vs solving solo
- Reduces single point of failure when on PTO

**Management Structure Change:**
- Transitioning to John as primary 1:1 manager (more familiar with day-to-day Red Panda work)
- Better positioned for promotion path discussions
- New cadence: John biweekly, Mark every 6 weeks

**Current Work:**
- BitBucket self-healing integration nearly complete
- Code changes done, working on end-to-end testing
- Challenge: BitBucket-specific git command nuances in client bundle
- Customer readiness mixed:
  - ADT wants it but blocked by Data Center version + AI approval process
  - Mecca potential trial candidate once ready
- Onboarding flow: Adding self-healing setup to workspace dashboard (GitHub/GitLab only due to API limitations)

**Team Allocation Framework:**
- 80% planned feature work, 20% customer issues/DPE requests
- All Slack requests require linear issue attachment
- Backlog process under review by John

### 2026-01-08

**Personal:**
- Just returned from 3-week break
- Got flu during last week (wife's family gathering ~30 people - everyone got sick except wife)
- Dealing with winter fatigue, needs vitamin D
- Planning sunny trip for March

**Work:**
- Self-healing UI onboarding: Basic functionality working pre-break
- 2 major PRs submitted yesterday/today
- Next: Adding BitBucket support (should be easier than Azure integration)

**Team:**
- Chow in different timezone - slower reviews but some morning overlap
- John returning Monday from extended break
- James out today, quiet week overall

**Other:**
- Finding FE performance review examples difficult for initiative questions
- Noted questions haven't been updated since FE started
- Plan to gather feedback this round for improvements

## Random Notes

- Weather: Foot of snow Sunday, then jumped to 50°F
