- Got flu during last week (wife's family gathering ~30 people - everyone got sick except wife)
- Dealing with winter fatigue, needs vitamin D

**Work:**
- Self-healing UI onboarding: Basic functionality working pre-break
- 2 major PRs submitted yesterday/today
- Next: Adding BitBucket support (should be easier than Azure integration)

- John returning Monday from extended break
- James out today, quiet week overall

**Other:**
- Finding FE performance review examples difficult for initiative questions
- Noted questions haven't been updated since FE started
