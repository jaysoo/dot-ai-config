## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-12

**Communication Pain Points:**
- Feature tracking challenges across DPE team
- Hard to stay informed about company updates
- Difficult to transfer information effectively to customers
- Currently using manual notes system for customer feature tracking
- Need to avoid repeating feature announcements to same customers
- No clear view of feature availability across environments
- Missing connection between bug fixes and customer notifications
- Unclear version requirements (NX CLI vs NX Cloud versions)
- Steven maintains personal Slack tracker with "waiting for release" column

**Proposed Solutions & Ideas:**
- Integrated notification system (Beamer-style in app with videos/walkthroughs)
- Feature matrix showing environments, versions, and feature flags
- Customer notification system with checkbox tracking per feature
- Enhanced change log & roadmap
  - Merge concepts similar to Shopify/Linear monthly feature posts
  - Include images, videos, not just text entries
  - Cover both CLI and Cloud platform features
  - Now/Next/Later roadmap granularity without specific dates
- Feature repository system
  - Manual metadata tracking owned by Product (Nicole)
  - Include version requirements, environment availability, VCS provider limitations
  - Allow collaborative editing and comments
  - Post-release status tracking beyond Linear completion

**Next Steps:**
- Steven: Create comprehensive feature list with desired metadata fields
- Jack: Review list and identify what's solved by roadmap vs change log vs new solutions
- Jack: Discuss with Victor (roadmap owner) and Nicole (change log) about implementation
- Consider adding "post-done" status in Linear for released features
