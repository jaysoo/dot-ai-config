## 1:1 Notes

### 2025-02-10

**Timezone Coordination & Workflow Efficiency:**
- Deadlines compound timezone issues - tighter schedules make delays more painful
- Need better overlap management, especially with Chau and Max in Vietnam
- When someone's work blocks others, avoid full-day waits for responses
  - Cross-training so others can pick up work even if slower
  - Better to have James spend 2 hours figuring out Max's work than wait 8 hours
- Encourage proactive handoffs when going offline
  - Ping relevant team members with context before signing off
  - Share information needed to push work through

**Project Management & Clarity:**
- Victor sets aggressive deadlines (Polygraph AI demo needed by Chinese New Year)
- Common issues with task clarity and scope management
  - Linear tasks often lack proper descriptions
  - People need to clarify urgency before dropping other work
  - Example: Agent onboarding task unclear - team built API endpoints without understanding end goal
- Recommend AI brainstorming sessions before starting work
- People should push back appropriately and ask clarifying questions rather than assume urgency

**Team Capacity & Current Projects:**
- Jon feels current workload manageable with AI assistance (Claude)
  - Self-healing CI in good state after cooldown period
  - Polygraph AI focus: Jon on UI (challenging for him), Victor on orchestration
  - Mark or Chau will join Polygraph team after self-healing work complete
- Unplanned work tracking: Use DPE/Support labels for customer requests
- Jon taking Capital One trip in couple weeks, may swap Friday/Monday for President's Day

### 2025-01-22

**Personal check-in:**
- Returned from Philippines trip last Friday (15-hour premium economy flight, delayed 4.5 hours due to Thursday snowstorm)
- Used new neck pillow attachment system for flight
- Spent morning helping neighbor's car stuck in snow
- Multiple snow layers requiring shoveling; researching snowblower options ($800-1500) vs rental

**Performance review feedback received:**
- Strengths: Strong communication, project tracking, incorporating customer feedback, staying current with industry trends
- Areas to improve: Share customer feedback incorporation more broadly with external stakeholders (internal team aware, external needs updates)
- All hands product updates shifting from Nicole doing all → individual team leads present their updates
- Jon should present Red Panda updates affecting customers/marketing

**Management structure changes:**
- Jon becoming direct manager for Red Panda team
- Will conduct 1:1s with Chau and Mark (every 2 weeks typical cadence)
- Jack reducing touchpoints to every 6 weeks for check-ins
- James remains special case reporting to Victor
- Increased team lead autonomy model - less "Victor disagrees so we don't do it" approach
- Team leads accountable for decisions and outcomes (similar to Steve's model)
- Jon created year-long work document while in Philippines; sent to Victor but not discussed yet

**SPACE Metrics implementation:**
- Five dimension tracking system for team performance
- Red Panda target: 80% planned, 20% unplanned work
- Currently tracking through Linear project assignment
- Process changes needed:
  - Move from single big issue list to proper project categorization
  - Ensure Slack issues get logged in Linear
  - Victor's priority system (high=this week, low=next week) needs adjustment
  - Consider adding due dates despite Victor's resistance
- Monthly review cadence planned

**Action items:**
- [ ] Jon: Schedule 1:1s with Chau and Mark
- [ ] Jon: Review year-long work document with Victor
- [ ] Jon: Restructure Linear from single list to project-based system
- [ ] Jack: Reschedule 1:1s with Chau and Mark to 6-week intervals
- [ ] Jack: Add NX Console to SPACE metrics tracking
- [ ] Jack: Fix suspicious zero counts in P0 issue resolution calculations
