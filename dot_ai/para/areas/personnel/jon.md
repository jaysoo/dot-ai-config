- Returned from Philippines trip last Friday (15-hour premium economy flight, delayed 4.5 hours due to Thursday snowstorm)
- Used new neck pillow attachment system for flight
- Spent morning helping neighbor's car stuck in snow
- Multiple snow layers requiring shoveling; researching snowblower options ($800-1500) vs rental

**Performance review feedback received:**
- Strengths: Strong communication, project tracking, incorporating customer feedback, staying current with industry trends
- Areas to improve: Share customer feedback incorporation more broadly with external stakeholders (internal team aware, external needs updates)
- All hands product updates shifting from Nicole doing all → individual team leads present their updates
- Jon should present Red Panda updates affecting customers/marketing

**Management structure changes:**
- Jon becoming direct manager for Red Panda team
- Will conduct 1:1s with Chau and Mark (every 2 weeks typical cadence)
- Jack reducing touchpoints to every 6 weeks for check-ins
- James remains special case reporting to Victor
- Increased team lead autonomy model - less "Victor disagrees so we don't do it" approach
- Team leads accountable for decisions and outcomes (similar to Steve's model)
- Jon created year-long work document while in Philippines; sent to Victor but not discussed yet

**SPACE Metrics implementation:**
- Five dimension tracking system for team performance

- Process changes needed:
  - Move from single big issue list to proper project categorization
  - Ensure Slack issues get logged in Linear
  - Victor's priority system (high=this week, low=next week) needs adjustment
  - Consider adding due dates despite Victor's resistance
- Monthly review cadence planned
