### L5 Promotion Doc Summary (2026-01)

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Observability Infrastructure:** Led migration from multiple self-hosted Grafana/Prometheus/Loki instances to unified Grafana Cloud (nx.grafana.net). Eliminated operational overhead, reduced costs, enabled cross-customer visibility.

2. **Security - Cache Poisoning Fix:** Discovered critical vulnerability during unrelated work - agents had arbitrary read/write to entire cache bucket. Designed and implemented token-based authorization system within two weeks. Prevented potential arbitrary code execution in customer CI.

3. **Cost Analysis System:** Built monthly infrastructure billing data exports by customer. Used by Finance for profitability analysis and Infra team for cost optimization decisions.

4. **Single-Tenant Operations:** Maintains 20+ single-tenant deployments (GCP/AWS) with near 100% uptime. Designed registry-build-cache system for enterprise customers.

**Recognition:** Company-wide observability SME - go-to person for Grafana questions, metrics interpretation, troubleshooting.
