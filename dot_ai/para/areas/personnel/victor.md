## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming

- `op` and `gh` CLI usage - confirm follow-up complete, discuss enforcement/reminders
  - Victor noticed 1Password rarely pops up during screenshares
  - Need to verify everyone is using gh with 1Password properly
- Laptop refreshes - policy/timeline/budget?
- Legal questions on terms for CLI stats tracking (GA) - what are the requirements?
- Team prioritization: how should teams balance revenue vs growth vs AI vs maintenance/general work?
- **Content & test harness help** - Need more content and assistance building giant test harnesses
  - "Harness Driven Development" (HDD): AI agents are too goal-oriented and will break things to achieve their goal
  - Humans don't need massive test harnesses because we're more mindful/careful, but AI *needs* them as guardrails
  - Want to discuss resourcing and prioritization for building these out

### 2026-02-09

**Time Zone Expectations**
- Need better overlap between remote team members
- Max and Chau (both in Europe/Asia) have minimal overlap with Eastern team
  - Currently ~2 hours overlap, need 3-4 hours minimum
  - European team should work until noon Eastern (5-6pm local)
  - Not about working Eastern hours, but ensuring collaboration windows
- Flexible schedule acceptable with exceptions, but general availability expected during overlap hours
- West Coast team (Nicole, Louis) less problematic due to fewer people

**Max Performance Feedback**
- Consistently delivers behind schedule despite capability
- European work-life balance approach less suitable for startup pace
- Needs to be more reliable for urgent tasks and team dependencies
- Less available than James (who's also remote but more responsive)
- Impacts ability to assign critical responsibilities
- Weekly sync with Jack starting to improve oversight

**Team Redundancy & Knowledge Sharing**
- Single points of failure problematic when people offline
- Need backup coverage for critical areas Chau owns
- Better documentation/handoff processes required
- Example: CNW changes worked well with detailed context sharing via Claude
- Knowledge base articles could help with migration examples and AI-assisted troubleshooting

**Agentic Onboarding Progress**
- CNW changes merged, JSON planning release this week
- Testing full end-to-end onboarding with Nicole's team
  - Goal: AI creates NX workspace with cloud setup via "YOLO mode"
  - Need to identify gaps where manual intervention required
- NX init improvements needed for AI compatibility
- Platform API changes required for full automation
- Considering embedding AI assistance directly in CNW/init commands
- Survey results show engineering teams don't understand how current work helps them

**Action Items**
- Jack: Talk to Max and Chau about time zone expectations
- Jack: Follow up with Nicole on agentic onboarding testing results
- Jack: Review init experience and sync with Nicole tomorrow
- Jack: Continue Orca triage support
- Victor: Explore API endpoints for automated platform setup

### 2026-02-02

**Board Meeting & Company Performance**
- Recent board meeting much less gloomy than Q3 meeting three months ago
- Q4 performance decent (not excellent but improved from very bad Q3)
- Better trends emerging, need to maintain momentum
- AI story clear with strong value proposition
  - Inevitable market direction
  - Limited competition in current space
- Company bonus increased from 0.5% to 0.9% to send positive message without being too harsh

**Team Structure & Performance Management**
- Nicole remains L5, considering team lead promotion this year
  - Alton stronger as de facto tech and project lead
  - Nicole needs stronger tech lead presence
  - Goal: 4.5 ARR self-serve (80% growth from current 2.5)
    - Realistic target based on 60% growth last year with minimal effort
    - Focus on UX optimization for onboarding/activation
- Chao and Mark reporting structure change
  - Move 1:1s from Nicole to John (Red Panda project)
  - Nicole lacks visibility into their work
  - Career growth discussions remain with Jack

**AI Agent Onboarding Project**
- Nicole owns overall experience, Max/Colin handle technical components
- Target: autonomous setup of new repos with full cloud connection
- Two-week timeline for initial implementation
  - Week 1: CNW build functionality
  - Week 2: INIT experience improvements
- Technical requirements
  - Single API endpoint for cloud setup
  - GitHub CLI integration (install app once, then autonomous)
  - Prompt iteration for coherent instructions
- 20-30% of website traffic now AI-driven (corrected from initial 60% miscalculation)

**Product Development Updates**
- Reverse trial feature technically complete
  - Requires manual approval process (1-day delay acceptable)
  - 300+ open source form submissions show user willingness to wait
  - Enterprise prospects likely won't be deterred by approval delay
- Polygraph progress
  - Current focus: dogfooding for internal use
  - Next phase: external usability for Nx users
  - Future: support non-Nx workspaces with manual edge drawing
  - 10-minute "time to wow" target for new users

**Marketing & Communication**
- Homepage and cloud pages must launch this week
  - Delayed multiple weeks despite minor AI/monetization language tweaks
  - Could be completed in one day of focused work
- Internal communication improvements needed
  - Weekly team lead updates to reduce information silos
  - Manual quarterly summary document for cross-team visibility
  - Jack to increase platform team familiarity to reduce Victor's context-spreading load

**Action Items for Jack**
- Continue career growth discussions with Chao and Mark
- Increase platform team familiarity to reduce Victor's context-spreading load
