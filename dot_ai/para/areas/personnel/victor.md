### 2026-01-08 - 360 Review Feedback (via Matt Hunter, executive coach)

**Context:** Anonymous feedback session - Jack chosen as one of 6 interviewees

**Strengths Highlighted:**
- Technical skills highly regarded by team
- Speed in production and learning new technologies
- Stays current with tech trends, blogs, books, courses
- Considers impact on both product and internal processes
- Hard worker with strong work ethic

**Building Teams & Results: 7/10**
- Strong when focused on specific metrics/deliverables - can pull 5+ person teams together effectively
- Weaker on overall multi-team management - less aware of teams he doesn't work with directly
- Example: Infrastructure team (3 people) - minimal touchpoints beyond cost discussions
- Relies on Jack for updates on team performance
- Missing metrics to properly assess team performance across organization

**Key Concerns Shared:**
- *Trust and autonomy:* Frequently overrides team lead decisions despite their closer product proximity; strong personality wears people down in debates; paywall implementation example
- *Communication:* Makes work appear more urgent than necessary; junior staff afraid to push back; lacks clarity on priorities for individuals and teams
- *Outdated perceptions:* Opinions based on year+ old impressions; doesn't recognize employee improvements over time; needs to trust team lead assessments more

**Relationship Context:**
- Jack and Victor were former coworkers (pre-Google, Toronto company)
- Worked as peers for ~1 year before Victor left to start current company
- Jack comfortable pushing back due to peer history
- Currently pushes back mainly on issues affecting team morale
- Weekly check-ins to discuss team performance and priorities
