## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-02-02

**Board Meeting & Company Performance**
- Recent board meeting much less gloomy than Q3 meeting three months ago
- Q4 performance decent (not excellent but improved from very bad Q3)
- Better trends emerging, need to maintain momentum
- AI story clear with strong value proposition
  - Inevitable market direction
  - Limited competition in current space
- Company bonus increased from 0.5% to 0.9% to send positive message without being too harsh

**Team Structure & Performance Management**
- Nicole remains L5, considering team lead promotion this year
  - Alton stronger as de facto tech and project lead
  - Nicole needs stronger tech lead presence
  - Goal: 4.5 ARR self-serve (80% growth from current 2.5)
    - Realistic target based on 60% growth last year with minimal effort
    - Focus on UX optimization for onboarding/activation
- Chao and Mark reporting structure change
  - Move 1:1s from Nicole to John (Red Panda project)
  - Nicole lacks visibility into their work
  - Career growth discussions remain with Jack

**AI Agent Onboarding Project**
- Nicole owns overall experience, Max/Colin handle technical components
- Target: autonomous setup of new repos with full cloud connection
- Two-week timeline for initial implementation
  - Week 1: CNW build functionality
  - Week 2: INIT experience improvements
- Technical requirements
  - Single API endpoint for cloud setup
  - GitHub CLI integration (install app once, then autonomous)
  - Prompt iteration for coherent instructions
- 20-30% of website traffic now AI-driven (corrected from initial 60% miscalculation)

**Product Development Updates**
- Reverse trial feature technically complete
  - Requires manual approval process (1-day delay acceptable)
  - 300+ open source form submissions show user willingness to wait
  - Enterprise prospects likely won't be deterred by approval delay
- Polygraph progress
  - Current focus: dogfooding for internal use
  - Next phase: external usability for Nx users
  - Future: support non-Nx workspaces with manual edge drawing
  - 10-minute "time to wow" target for new users

**Marketing & Communication**
- Homepage and cloud pages must launch this week
  - Delayed multiple weeks despite minor AI/monetization language tweaks
  - Could be completed in one day of focused work
- Internal communication improvements needed
  - Weekly team lead updates to reduce information silos
  - Manual quarterly summary document for cross-team visibility
  - Jack to increase platform team familiarity to reduce Victor's context-spreading load

**Action Items for Jack**
- Continue career growth discussions with Chao and Mark
- Increase platform team familiarity to reduce Victor's context-spreading load
