## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming 1:1

Strengths:

- Innovative thinking for delivering PoV that sets a strong foundation for future partnerships (e.g. Skyscanner)
- Very helpful on the DPE side, and very autonomous
- Broad knowledge across the app, backend, and infra
- Only app SME in EU timezone, and helped mentor Szymon
- SME for private cloud
- Go-to for CI stability
- Skilled at debugging issues for enterprise customers, like git credential functionality
- Work is very thorough and lots of context provided
- Very responsive on Slack and emails (Andrew: most productive in EU at identifying and solving problems)

Most valuable contribution:

- Skyscanner and Legora
- Advocate for Docker Layer Caching and conducting performance analysis
- Ocean and Nx CI stability
- Enterprise Prometheus API
- Steven: EU DPE work, and partnering with Andrew to take some burden from Steven and Miro

Improvements:

- Keep making Looms, very helpful to understand different topics; very good at explaining things
- Continue with performnace improvements on the Quokka team
- Helping with some infra work/knowledge, especially since Szymon is the only person in EU

Others:

- Andrew: " Working with Rares has been one of the highlights of 2025."

### 2026-01-29

**Performance Reviews & L5 Promotion**
- Reviews overwhelmingly positive with specific, applicable feedback
  - Reviewers knew his work well, covered major projects
  - Andrew (Skyscanner): "Working with Rares was highlight of the year"
- L5 promotion confirmed and processed
  - Updated promotion document same day
  - Expressed gratitude for Jack and Nicole's support

**2026 Role Structure & Responsibilities**
- Maintaining 50/50 split between engineering and sales work
- New ownership areas for L5+ level:
  - NX repo became slow this week, needs investigation
  - Focus on maintaining fast pipelines for team productivity
  - 70% planned work, 30% unplanned issues/requests
- Quokka team formation working well
  - Alton very supportive and efficient in new lead role
  - Good design discussions and API improvement focus
  - All three members (Rares, Louis, Alton) aligned on work

**Current Workload Balance Challenges**
- Heavy sales demands this week conflicting with engineering milestones:
  - Anna Plan POV support during EU hours
  - Miro/Essent POV finalization
  - Legora handover to Steven
  - WIX business case development with Andrea
- Tracing project delays due to:
  - Design changes and legal complications
  - Sales work taking priority over weekly engineering commitments
- Agreed approach:
  1. Prioritize sales when deals at risk or high urgency
  2. Ask key questions: What happens if not done? Who else can do this?
  3. Implement time-blocking constraints (e.g., dedicated engineering days)
  4. Maintain ~50/50 balance over time, allow short-term fluctuations
- Action items:
  - Rares to discuss capacity planning with Joe today
  - Miro taking over Essent work to free up Rares for milestone completion
