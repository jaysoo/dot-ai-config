## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming

- Java: Gradle patch runner status - may reassign to Louis or Max takes few days to complete
- Backlog grooming - remove items without descriptions, add due dates to all TODOs
  - Currently 21 items, could grow to 40+; with Colum at 1-2 issues/week = 20+ week burn-down
  - Higher quality gate: spec out or remove
- Agent tutorials may move to docs team (overlap with NX Learn)

### 2026-02-19

#### Migration Project Planning
- Overall approach approved - break into milestones and tasks
- Most work outside CLI scope; Colum has working local example proving minimal CLI changes needed
- Keep Leo in loop for debugging migrate issues and CLI improvements
  - Leo expected to deliver tasks/specs before March
- Core migration without framework updates most impactful but likely won't pursue
  - Framework updates where agentic approach helps most

#### Verification and Documentation
- Need verification steps beyond automated tasks
  - Angular: check component patterns updated correctly
  - React 19: verify deprecated features replaced
- Leverage existing markdown examples, expand with more detail
- Ship migration instructions as metadata for agents
- Generate summary blocks for humans post-migration

#### Timeline and Resources
- Start first week of March (post-cooldown)
- Max ~70% agentic migrations, remainder Console/Java maintenance
- Colum contributing 1 day/week but need faster feedback cycles
  - Consider Monday/Wednesday split vs weekly to avoid multi-week delays
- Java wrapping up next week except Gradle patch runner

#### CLI and Agent Integration
- Import command enhancement: separate plugin selection step
  - Don't default to all plugins; let agents ask users which ones
  - Provide educational links about plugin benefits through agent
- Future: invert control so agents get plans vs calling our tools
  - Start with prompts in NX dev for migration benchmarking
  - Experiment with Claude integration later

#### Project Management
- QA column currently ad-hoc waiting on Cursor/Claude feedback
  - Will use proper QA step going forward, review in syncs
- All TODO items need due dates

### 2026-02-12

- **AX: init flow for AI agents** - Should `init` ask users if they want an AI agent to handle the process? Could generate a markdown file with instructions for the AI to follow. More consistent than hints from CLI tools.

- Time zone expectations conversation (from Victor 1:1 2026-02-09)
  - Need 3-4 hours overlap with Eastern team (noon ET = 6pm CET)
  - Not about working Eastern hours, but ensuring collaboration windows
  - More reliable availability for urgent tasks

### Feedback (from Victor 1:1 2026-02-09)

- Consistently delivers behind schedule despite capability
- European work-life balance approach less suitable for startup pace
- Needs to be more reliable for urgent tasks and team dependencies
- Less available than James (who's also remote but more responsive)
- Impacts ability to assign critical responsibilities
- Weekly sync with Jack starting to improve oversight
