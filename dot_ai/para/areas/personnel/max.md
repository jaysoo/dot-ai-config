## 1:1 Notes

### Upcoming

- **AX: init flow for AI agents** - Should `init` ask users if they want an AI agent to handle the process? Could generate a markdown file with instructions for the AI to follow. More consistent than hints from CLI tools.

- Time zone expectations conversation (from Victor 1:1 2026-02-09)
  - Need 3-4 hours overlap with Eastern team (noon ET = 6pm CET)
  - Not about working Eastern hours, but ensuring collaboration windows
  - More reliable availability for urgent tasks

### Feedback (from Victor 1:1 2026-02-09)

- Consistently delivers behind schedule despite capability
- European work-life balance approach less suitable for startup pace
- Needs to be more reliable for urgent tasks and team dependencies
- Less available than James (who's also remote but more responsive)
- Impacts ability to assign critical responsibilities
- Weekly sync with Jack starting to improve oversight
