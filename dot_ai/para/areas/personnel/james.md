**Effy Review Process Feedback (from Heidi)**

1. **STOP** - questions that don't yield valuable info:
   - "What is the most valuable contribution they have made to the company during the last six months?" — This one often gets answered by way of the other questions like "How well have they demonstrated the skills/knowledge required for their role/level?"

2. **CONTINUE** - questions that do yield valuable info:
   - "How often do they take the initiative in identifying and solving problems (irrespective of their role/level)?" — Heidi's favorite question because it aids in helpful feedback on what they're doing well or growth opportunities. It's a clear indicator no matter the role if they're on the path to promotion or need coaching.
   - "What's one thing they could do to increase their impact?" — Shows growth opportunity, applies to everyone

3. **START** - suggestions:
   - A lot of the questions are about how people perform for their level; for engineers it's easier because there's documentation
   - Helpful for non-eng teams for team leads to put something together that explains what's expected of their team
   - Example: Juri reviewed Caitlin but said a few times he wasn't sure what her role entailed
   - Philip's role has shifted a bit in the last few years so people expected him to be doing things that weren't his priorities anymore
   - Heidi could write up a bulleted list of what a Marketing Manager is responsible for and people could reference that before they review Caitlin moving forward

**Performance Review Process Discussion**
- Need specific feedback from stakeholders (Madeline, Joe) and non-engineering teams
- Focus on actionable items for engineers rather than general "does it work well" questions
- Key areas to explore:
  - Actionable items coming out of reviews (promotions, PIPs, assessments)
  - Missing information not captured in current process
  - Request one specific improvement point from each reviewer
- Sales team over-indexing on positive feedback (99% "strongly exceeding")
  - Engineering has better critical evaluation practices due to Victor's direct guidance
  - Need stronger communication to individual contributors about being more critical
  - End users don't see feedback, should enable more direct comments

**Reporting Structure Changes**
- Mark and Chau moved from Jack's reviews to John's management
  - Reduces Jack's review load
  - John has better context for specific feedback and quality issues
  - Makes more sense given team alignment
- Mark performance observations:
  - Has technical capability but lacks motivation to push himself
  - Currently L4A, can easily move to L4B/C
  - Several instances of insufficient follow-up on shipped features
  - Not meeting senior-level potential despite high capability

**360 Review Integration**
- Victor completed 360 review; need lessons learned from that experience
- Considering adding upward feedback component to current FE process
- May implement outside of regular cycle
- FE has established 360 template that can be modified
- Will discuss with Victor in upcoming 1:1s

**Space Metrics Implementation**
- Steve helping implement into Lighthouse dashboard
- Holistic health measurement across activity, performance, efficiency, collaboration, satisfaction
- Key metrics being tracked:
  - PR throughput (ignoring lines of code due to AI impact)
  - Planned vs unplanned work allocation (40% unplanned in Q4 for Orca)
  - PR merge time (median good, P75 problematic - yellow flag at 3+ days)
- Red Panda team challenges:
  - Continuous delivery model doesn't fit traditional project planning
  - Priority definitions misaligned (high/urgent used for ordering, not actual urgency)
  - Weekly commitment model with Monday planning works well for AI-driven changes
- Proposed solutions:
  1. Use due dates set to end of week for committed items
  2. Track customer-reported issues with proper linear labeling
  3. Classify true P0/P1 incidents as urgent priority
- Additional metric consideration: Track reverted PRs as code quality indicator

**Employee Satisfaction Survey**
- Quarterly 2-minute survey covering 5 dimensions:
  1. Autonomy vs micromanagement
  2. Work value/connection
  3. Role growth and clarity
  4. Open disagreement culture
  5. Manager relationships
- Anonymous format with space for "one thing to make work easier" feedback
- Will send to James for review before implementation

**AI Usage and Metrics**
- Token count tracking from 4 people, but problematic as sole metric
  - Gregory's usage 4x higher than James despite similar workflows
  - Cursor users consume 4-25x more tokens due to tab completion
  - Raw token count gameable and not productivity-correlated
- Need counterbalancing metrics (PR merges, meaningful output)
- Victor wants leaderboard approach to encourage adoption
- Current adoption status:
  - All engineering teams using AI except Simon (minimal Juni usage)
  - Mark previously resistant but improving
  - Steve uses extensively for planning and ideation
  - Patrick increasing Claude Code usage
- Proposed AI champion role: One person per team, half day bi-weekly to assess tools and push adoption

**Administrative and Next Steps**
- FE payment issue: Card declined, Thomas handling vendor card setup
- Bonuses processed and logged (Jack and James pending Victor's decisions)
- Chow promoted to L4C, on track for L5 trial next cycle
  - Fast execution but needs more meaningful independent work
  - Previous issues with requiring extensive Victor guidance on complex tasks
- People by Wage Point level corrections needed before next review cycle
- Operations manager hiring in progress to prevent administrative gaps
