## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-22 - Team restructuring & role clarity

**Team formation shifting:**
- Moving to vertical specialization (UI, backend, etc.) vs. previous full-stack approach
- Ben's L6 role ownership concerns addressed
  - Will remain main owner of Framer work despite others helping
  - Frontend health and tooling ownership moving to Orca team
  - AI integration responsibilities across frontend vertical
- Review process delays due to Victor's unavailability
  - Jack planning to move Ben under Nicole for reviews
  - Simpler alternative to current blocked process

**AI tooling & optimization:**
- Graphite usage evaluation - can we remove it? Who is using it?
  - Ben suggests Claude's built-in review superior to Graphite
  - Claude has full context vs. Graphite's limited scope
  - Mass removal consideration if no active usage found
- AI frontend development gaps identified
  - Charts and complex UI still challenging for AI
  - Need better instructions/tooling for design consistency
  - Ben experimenting with Claude skills during Christmas break
- Documentation optimization for AI consumption
  - Markdown files more efficient than HTML parsing
  - Front matter usage for better AI understanding

**Current work status & technical updates:**
- Ready to merge PRs:
  - Color styling changes completed and passing
  - Advent of code page removal and redirects ready
- Framer partner page completed
  - Responsive components built
  - Vector assets created for partner logos
  - Custom domain investigation needed for robot.txt handling
- Netlify analytics activated ($9/month) for NX docs
  - Limited usefulness - only shows top 25 pages
  - Missing detailed MD file tracking Jack needs
  - Real user monitoring available but overlaps with Grafana
- Deploy approval email spam (40/day) needs resolution
  - Jack mass-rejecting old queue via API
  - Settings adjustment needed to reduce noise
