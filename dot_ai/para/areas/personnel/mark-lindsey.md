## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-02-05

**Current Work Focus**
- Moving visibility feature from organizations to workspaces
  - Big change requiring migration for existing workspaces
  - Multiple PRs for UI changes and front-end permissions
- Miscellaneous bug fixes from testing and triage board

**Team Collaboration & Expertise**
- Chow remains auth subject matter expert
  - Will continue reviewing auth-related work even on Red Panda team
  - Available for unplanned auth issues as they arise
- Mark as VCS integration expert for Orca team support
  - Nicole sending items for review this week
  - Orca team (Nicole, Ben, Dylan) allocated more time for small bugs
  - Should handle simple issues independently before escalating

**AI Agent Onboarding Initiative**
- Goal: Make agentic onboarding rock solid
- Two objectives:
  1. Smooth experience without weird behavior
  2. Improve onboarding conversion numbers
- GitHub app installation constraint
  - Must go through browser - no API for app installation
  - Nicole attempted to remove OAuth authorization (blocked by Mark)
- Potential improvements:
  - GitHub Personal Access Token flow could work via CLI
  - Prompt users to generate PAT in terminal
  - Reduce onboarding screens by sending to OAuth page directly
- Dylan will handle initial changes, loop in Mark as needed

**Process Changes**
- Mark setting up 1:1s with John starting next week
  - Jack's 1:1s moving to monthly/every 4 weeks
  - Focus on Red Panda team processes and projects
- Validation approach for new features
  - Shorten iteration loops with early customer/internal validation
  - Example: ADP plugin issue - validate ad hoc solution before building feature
  - Avoid 2-week development cycles without feedback

**Action Items**
- [ ] Mark to ask Victor about onsite timing (vacation conflict)
- [ ] Jack to mention onsite to Victor in Monday 1:1
- [ ] Continue current workspace visibility migration work
- [ ] Support Orca team as VCS integration issues arise
