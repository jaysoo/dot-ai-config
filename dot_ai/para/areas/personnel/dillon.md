## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-21

**AI Tools & Cursor Usage Analytics**
- Collected usage data on various Nrwl tools
- Cursor analytics available in dashboard (cursor.com/analytics)
- Team CSV export shows everyone's usage metrics
- Dillon mainly uses Cursor, trying to use it more for work projects
- Team AI tool preferences: Most use Claude Code (99% of Jack's usage), Altan uses OpenAI Code, Steve uses both (mostly Claude Code), Chau uses "bucket thing"
- Max plan ($200) subsidized but team plan ($150) doesn't include Max features
- API usage burns through $100+ quickly (under a week for real work)
- Personal/work separation recommended if heavy personal usage to avoid skewing stats

**Team Responsibilities & Knowledge Sharing**
- Expanding bug triage and customer support beyond Chau
- Target: 70-75% feature work, 25% support/triage for team members
- Need knowledge transfer from Chau on auth and other areas
- Dillon/Nicole/Ben will help with customer requests going forward
- Grafana learning priority - Patrick most knowledgeable, available for help
- Chau to provide live pairing sessions rather than just looms for realistic workflow learning
- Linear tracking enforcement: All work must be structured in Linear

**Onboarding Metrics & Traffic Analysis**
- Browser numbers recovering post-holiday but actual conversions still down
- Suspicious traffic from China (#1) and Singapore needs filtering
- Average session duration ~3 seconds indicates bot/scraper activity
- Created A/B testing ticket for onboarding conversion improvements
- Nicole implementing pieces of optimization ideas
- Need weekly metric reviews and specific funnel stage targeting

**Action Items**
- [ ] Jack: Set up Dillon on team AI plan and track down 401k contact (Thomas)
- [ ] Jack: Share custom Claude Code commands and summarization workflow
- [ ] Dillon: Create separate Nrwl account for AI usage to avoid stat skewing
- [ ] Dillon: Improve Linear pulse update consistency
- [ ] Team: Implement knowledge sharing sessions with Chau (live pairing preferred)
