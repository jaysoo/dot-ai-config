## 1:1 Notes

### 2026-01-27

**Topic:** Team Communication, Roadmap & Pricing Strategy

#### Jason's Communication & Team Concerns

- Engineering team interprets Jason's questions in all-hands as criticism of sales value
  - Multiple Slack messages from engineers asking "why is this happening?"
  - Not Jason's intent - trying to understand workflow/process
- Feedback for Jason: reframe questioning to feel more productive
- Context: Jason and Victor often have long discussions/arguments
  - Steve similar communication style - good ideas but delivery issues
- Engineering team anxiety stems from layoffs last year
  - Most terminated employees were already on PIPs
  - Engineers question if following leadership leads to company success
  - Want visibility into pipeline health and company direction

#### Roadmap & Revenue Strategy

- 2024 focus: CI-focused roadmap with cloud integration
- Major upcoming features:
  - Auto-update packages/frameworks without manual effort
  - AI agents read docs, verify work, submit PRs
  - Reduce migration time from weeks to ~1 day review
- Top-of-funnel optimization experiments
  - NX downloads growing 30-40% year-over-year consistently
  - Challenge: converting downloads to Cloud connections/usage
- Non-TypeScript/JavaScript language support continues
  - Major investment last year with limited results so far
  - Maven staying as-is after recent concerns

#### Pricing & Feature Strategy Discussion

- Current approach: build feature → debate free vs paid placement
- Madeline's proposed framework: base pricing on user persona
  - Individual developer → Hobby tier
  - Small team collaboration → Teams tier
  - Executive/enterprise-wide value → Enterprise tier
- Challenge: balancing short-term revenue pressure vs long-term strategy
- Recent wins: Self-healing CI, Pro-to-Teams transition (~$500K additional revenue)
- Engineering survey results (Madeline's scores 1-5):
  - Collaboration: 5
  - Transparency: 4-5 (varies by meeting access)
  - Responsiveness: 5
  - Predictability: 2-3 (internal requests delayed)
  - Value delivery: 4

#### Engineering Partnership Survey (Detailed Responses)

| Question | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Value Delivery** - "Engineering delivers features that help me do my job" | 5 | |
| **Predictability** - "Engineering delivers on time and as expected" | 1-2 | "Lots of non-dev work isn't followed up on" |
| **Responsiveness** - "When I report a bug or issue, it gets resolved in a reasonable time" | 5 | |
| **Transparency** - "I understand what engineering is working on and why" | 5 | "But I know what's going on because of Victor" |
| **Collaboration** - "Engineering is easy to collaborate with" | 5 | |

**Open-Ended Feedback:**

- **What could engineering do better?**
  - The way we think about pricing strategy
  - Need more holistic understanding: Is feature for one person (Hobby), small team (Teams), or enterprise (Enterprise)?

- **What has engineering done well recently?**
  - Self-healing CI
  - Pro to Teams transition

#### Next Steps

- [ ] Jack to provide Jason feedback on communication style
- [ ] Jack to send engineering team survey to broader group
- [ ] Monthly sync between Jack and Madeline established
- [ ] Focus on identifying/fixing POV blockers and performance issues
