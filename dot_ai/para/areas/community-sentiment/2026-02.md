- The 60% unresponded rate is concerning — triage cadence may need attention

## Emerging Patterns
1. Rspack hitting growth phase — edge cases piling up
2. Module Federation remains most complex surface area
3. Build tool pluralism creating maintenance pressure
4. Package manager fragmentation continues to bite
5. WASM/non-standard environments emerging demand (#27263, 35 reactions)
