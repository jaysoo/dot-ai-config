# Archive

Inactive items from projects, areas, and resources.

## Purpose

The archive contains items that are no longer active but may be useful for future reference:
- Completed projects
- Discontinued areas
- Outdated resources

## Structure

Preserve the original folder structure when archiving:

```
archive/
├── projects/     # Completed or abandoned projects
├── areas/        # Discontinued areas of responsibility
└── resources/    # Outdated reference materials
```

## Archived Items

*No archived items*

## Archiving Process

1. Move item from its current location to corresponding archive folder
2. Preserve folder structure (e.g., `areas/old-area/` → `archive/areas/old-area/`)
3. Add note at top of README with archive date and reason

Example archive header:

```markdown
> **Archived:** 2026-01-15
> **Reason:** Project completed / No longer relevant / Superseded by X
```
