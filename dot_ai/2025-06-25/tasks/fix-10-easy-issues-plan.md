# Plan: Fix 10 Easy Nx Issues

**Created**: 2025-06-25
**Purpose**: Fix 10 easy issues identified from nx-easy-issues analysis using git worktrees

## Overview

Fix 10 issues across documentation and code using separate git worktrees to avoid conflicts. Each issue will be verified with Gemini for confidence assessment before implementation.

## Worktree Strategy

Create a base worktree directory:
```bash
mkdir -p /Users/jack/projects/nx-worktrees
```

For each issue, create a worktree:
```bash
git worktree add /Users/jack/projects/nx-worktrees/fix-issue-{number} -b fix/issue-{number}
```

## Issues to Fix

### Documentation Issues (8)
1. **#30831** - `@nx/angular:webpack-browser` incorrect documentation
2. **#30181** - Playwright grep docs using glob not regex
3. **#29648** - lintFilePatterns is mandatory property
4. **#30649** - Meaning of "*" version in package.json
5. **#29323** - Lack of documentation about release options in nx.json
6. **#31574** - Clarify how gitignore affects nx inputs
7. **#30163** - Missing nx release/publish documentation
8. **#30058** - Troubleshooting global installs of nx

### Code Issues (2)
9. **#29358** - Update esbuild dependency version
10. **#30937** - Webpack libraryTarget not respected

## Phase 1: Verification and Confidence Assessment

For each issue:
1. Read full issue details and comments
2. Identify exact files that need changes
3. Use Gemini to verify understanding and approach
4. Assess confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

## Phase 2: Implementation Strategy

### For Documentation Issues:
1. Create worktree
2. Find relevant documentation files
3. Make focused changes
4. Run docs build to verify
5. Commit with proper message
6. Push branch

### For Code Issues:
1. Create worktree
2. Find affected source files
3. Make minimal code changes
4. Run affected tests
5. Run prepush validation
6. Commit and push

## Phase 3: Pull Request Creation

For each completed fix:
1. Create PR using template
2. Include "Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER"
3. Provide clear description
4. Link to issue

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Set up base directory
```bash
mkdir -p /Users/jack/projects/nx-worktrees
cd /Users/jack/projects/nx
```

### Step 2: Process each issue

#### Issue #30831 - @nx/angular:webpack-browser documentation
- [ ] Read issue and identify documentation location
- [ ] Check `packages/angular/src/builders/webpack-browser/webpack-browser.impl.ts` and understand how `indexHtmlTransformer` is called
  - It looks like it's a function that accepts two args: 1) Target config (from @angular-devkit/architect); 2) the index.html string
  - I think you just need to update the schema.json description
- [ ] Verify with Gemini
- [ ] Create worktree: `git worktree add ../nx-worktrees/fix-issue-30831 -b fix/issue-30831`
- [ ] Fix documentation
- [ ] Test and commit

#### Issue #29358 - esbuild dependency update
- [ ] Read issue and identify package.json location
- [ ] Research what's been changed in esbuild since our very old version, look out for breaking changes and make note if we can migrate ALL users over without any breakages -- or we can make sure new workspaces generate with the new version, but not migrate existing projects over

3. **fix/issue-29648** - lintFilePatterns optional documentation

5. **fix/issue-29358** - esbuild dependency update

Total: 5 issues fixed, 5 branches ready for PRs

## Verification Results

### Documentation Issues (All HIGH/MEDIUM confidence)
1. **#30831**: Add function signature `(target: BuilderTarget, indexHtml: string) => string` and examples
2. **#30181**: Change "glob" to "regex" in two doc files
3. **#29648**: Change "mandatory" to "optional with default ['{projectRoot}']"
4. **#30649**: Explain "*" means "any version" with warnings about risks
5. **#29323**: Document all release configuration options in nx.json
6. **#31574**: Explain gitignore excludes files from Nx inputs
7. **#30163**: Create comprehensive release/publish command docs
8. **#30058**: Add common troubleshooting for global install issues

### Code Issues
9. **#29358**: Update esbuild peer dependency to "^0.22.0" - REQUIRES:
   - Testing with multiple esbuild versions (0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.25)
   - Checking for breaking changes in esbuild changelog
   - Running full test suite
10. **#30937**: Already fixed - no action needed

## Updated Approach

1. Start with documentation issues (higher confidence, lower risk)
2. Leave esbuild update for last (needs more testing)
3. Skip #30937 as it's already fixed
4. Total issues to fix: 9 (not 10)
