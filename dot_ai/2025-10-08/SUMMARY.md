### DOC-260: Update TailwindCSS Guides (2025-10-07)

**Linear Issue**: https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-260/update-tailwindcss-guides

Updated Tailwind CSS documentation to remove deprecated generator references and provide simple manual setup instructions compatible with both Tailwind v3 and v4.

**Files Modified**:
- `astro-docs/src/content/docs/technologies/angular/Guides/using-tailwind-css-with-angular-projects.mdoc`
- `astro-docs/src/content/docs/technologies/react/Guides/using-tailwind-css-in-react.mdoc`

**Key Changes**:
- Removed all references to `setup-tailwind` generators and `--add-tailwind` flags
- Removed dependency on `createGlobPatternsForDependencies` utility
- Added manual 5-step setup instructions
- Provided configurations for both Tailwind v3 and v4
- Used simple glob patterns (e.g., `join(__dirname, '../../libs/**/*.{ts,html}')`)
- Added Tailwind v4 specific configuration using `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin

**Benefits**:
- Version agnostic - users can adopt Tailwind v4 immediately
- Simpler setup (~2 minutes)
- More flexible and customizable
- Better understanding of how Tailwind integrates with their project

**Verification**: Created test workspace with Tailwind v4 and verified installation, configuration, and build process.
