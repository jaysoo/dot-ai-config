**Date:** 2026-01-08 (Thursday)

## Quoka Team Status & New Cycle Kickoff

- Team performing well despite slow start due to holiday rollover
- Kickoffs completed for all first projects as of meeting time
- Declaring bankruptcy on leftover Orca projects
  - Some reprioritized with current cycle work
  - Work changing hands or no longer relevant
- Next week is when real efforts begin
- No major fires with new releases

## Tracing Project Coordination

- Key project requiring interface between Rares, Craigory, and Jason
- Need 80% certainty on approach with minimal back-and-forth
- **Deadline pressure:** June 15th-20th target
  - Missing this creates delays
- Milestones now established, Craigory's team already started

## Team Resource Management

- Raj at 50% capacity on backend work
- Historical issue: difficulty finishing tasks due to context switching
- Jack working with Raj on scoping down work and finding additional support

## Q1 Performance Metrics Framework

Two clear cycle-based metrics identified:
1. **Flaky task retries** across workspace samples
2. **DTE (Development Time Experience)** improvements

Additional considerations:
- Both performance and product value related
- Secondary consideration: reducing useless alerts/noise
- Need ongoing monitoring beyond project completion
- Structure similar to Linear Team's approach for non-ending projects

## 2026 Team Performance Tracking Initiative

Five core metrics using SPACE framework expansion of DORA:

| # | Metric | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **PR Throughput** | 2025 showed higher output (likely AI-driven), monitoring post-layoff regression |
| 2 | **AI Usage Efficiency** | Token counting vs actual output correlation |
| 3 | **Work Allocation Performance** | Target 75% planned vs 25% unplanned work for Quoka |
| 4 | **PR Cycle Time** | P75 target under 24 hours, currently meeting goals |
| 5 | **P1 Issue Resolution** | Continue existing Linear tracking |

- Quarterly satisfaction surveys planned
- Jack traveling to Cancun Thursday-Wednesday, discussion resuming after return

## Action Items

- [ ] **Altan & Louis:** Identify 2-3 key metrics for team focus (deadline: end of January)
- [ ] **Altan:** Add Jack and Victor to Quoka channel for code reviews and communication
- [ ] **Jack:** Share detailed metrics framework document with team leads
- [ ] Continue AI Czar discussion after Jack returns from vacation
