# Redirect Test Final Report - DOC-154

## Test Environment
- **Astro Server**: Running on port 9003
- **nx-dev Server**: Running on port 4200 with NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL=http://localhost:9003
- **Total Redirects Configured**: 167

## Key Finding
The redirects are NOT working as expected. The nx-dev server is not redirecting to the Astro server but instead serving content at different paths than configured.

## Test Results

### Sample Test (14 URLs tested)
- ✅ **5 successful redirects** (36%)
- ❌ **9 failed redirects** (64%)

### Successful Redirects
These redirects worked correctly:
1. `/getting-started` → `/docs/getting-started`
2. `/features/run-tasks` → `/docs/features/run-tasks`
3. `/concepts/mental-model` → `/docs/concepts/mental-model`
4. `/recipes/troubleshooting/ts-solution-style` → Redirected (but to wrong path)
5. `/recipes/vite/set-up-vite-manually` → Redirected

### Failed Redirects
These redirects went to incorrect destinations:

| Old Path | Expected | Actual |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `/recipes/troubleshooting/clear-the-cache` | `/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-cache-misses` | `/troubleshooting/clear-the-cache` |
| `/recipes/module-federation/create-a-host` | `/docs/technologies/module-federation/Guides/create-a-host` | `/technologies/module-federation/recipes/create-a-host` |
| `/recipes/react/using-tailwind-css-in-react` | `/docs/technologies/react/Guides/using-tailwind-css-in-react` | `/technologies/react/recipes/using-tailwind-css-in-react` |
| `/recipes/angular/angular-dynamic-module-federation` | `/docs/technologies/angular/Guides/dynamic-module-federation-with-angular` | `/technologies/angular/recipes/angular-dynamic-module-federation` |

| `/recipes/tips-n-tricks/flat-config` | `/docs/technologies/eslint/Guides/flat-config` | `/technologies/eslint/recipes/flat-config` |

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that:
1. **The nx-dev server is NOT redirecting to the Astro server** (port 9003)
2. **It's serving content locally** at different paths than we configured
3. **The NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL environment variable may not be working as expected**

The actual redirect pattern observed is:
- `/recipes/{category}/{item}` → `/technologies/{tech}/recipes/{item}`

This is different from our configured pattern:
- `/recipes/{category}/{item}` → `/docs/technologies/{tech}/Guides/{item}`

## Recommendations

1. **Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL is being used correctly** in the nx-dev application
2. **Check if there are other redirect rules** taking precedence over our redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js
3. **Test with production build** instead of development server
4. **Consider if the redirect logic needs to actually redirect to the Astro server URL** rather than just changing paths

## Files Updated
- `nx-dev/nx-dev/redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js` - Contains 167 redirect rules

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL is not causing redirects to the Astro server
2. Check if there's a different mechanism needed for cross-server redirects
3. Verify the redirect rules are being loaded and applied correctly
