# Daily Summary - 2025-08-21

## Tasks Completed

### DOC-107: Update non-doc pages with new `/docs` prefix
- **Linear Issue**: https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-107/
- **Status**: Completed Phase 1 and Phase 2
- **Branch**: DOC-107

#### Work Done:
1. **Phase 1: Updated Non-Doc Page Links**
   - Found 4 documentation links in 3 files needing updates
   - Updated all links to include `/docs` prefix
   - Files modified:
     - `docs/blog/2023-09-18-introducing-playwright-support-for-nx.md`
     - `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages/changelog.tsx`
     - `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages/plugin-registry.tsx`

2. **Phase 2: Created Redirect Mappings**
   - Analyzed 506 documentation URLs from nx.dev sitemap
   - Generated 145 redirect mappings (36 high confidence)
   - Created configuration files for Next.js redirects

3. **Verification**
   - Tested astro-docs site on port 8000
   - Verified intro page renders correctly with Playwright

## Scripts Created
- `find-non-doc-pages.mjs` - Scans for documentation links in non-doc pages
- `create-redirect-mappings.mjs` - Initial redirect mapping generator
- `create-redirect-mappings-v2.mjs` - Improved redirect mapping with confidence levels

## Lessons Learned
- Astro projects in Nx use `npx astro dev` not `npm run dev`
- Always update TODO checkboxes in plan files, not just tracking tool
- Astro sitemap URLs need `/docs` prefix added for production

## Next Steps
- Review uncertain redirect mappings (361 URLs need manual review)
- Implement redirect configuration in nx-dev Next.js app
- Test redirects in staging environment
