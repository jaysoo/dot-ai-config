# MCP Server Improvements Task

**Created:** 2025-06-12
**Priority:** High
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Implement improvements to the MCP AI Content Server based on Gemini's comprehensive code review.

## Gemini's Key Feedback

### 1. Architecture Improvements
- Implement layered architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access layers)
- Add dependency injection for better testability
- Consider event-driven architecture for directory monitoring
- Use well-defined data models (dataclasses)

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement incremental indexing instead of full re-indexing
- Consider vector database (FAISS, Annoy) for semantic search
- Add batch processing for file operations
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Explore multiprocessing for parallel tasks

### 3. Error Handling & Security
- Add comprehensive try/except blocks with proper logging
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Set resource limits to prevent DoS
- Validate file paths to prevent path traversal
- Add rate limiting

### 4. Code Quality
- Add type hints throughout
- Improve documentation with docstrings
- Follow PEP 8 strictly with black/flake8
- Reduce code duplication (DRY principle)
- Keep functions short and focused

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for each module
- Add integration tests for module interactions
- Create comprehensive test data sets
- Use mocking to isolate modules
- Set up CI pipeline

### 6. Critical Issues to Fix
- **Race conditions** between directory monitor and content indexer
- **Memory leaks** - ensure proper resource cleanup
- **Security vulnerabilities** - sanitize all inputs
- **Performance bottlenecks** - especially in full re-indexing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (High Priority)
1. Fix race conditions in directory monitoring
2. Add input validation and security measures
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add proper logging throughout

### Phase 2: Architecture Refactoring
1. Implement layered architecture
2. Add dependency injection framework
3. Create proper data models with dataclasses
4. Add configuration management with pydantic

### Phase 3: Performance Improvements
1. Implement incremental indexing
2. Add connection pooling and caching
3. Optimize semantic search with vector database
4. Add batch processing

### Phase 4: Quality & Testing
1. Add type hints to all modules
2. Improve documentation
3. Write comprehensive unit tests
4. Set up integration tests
5. Configure CI pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Start with fixing the critical race condition issues
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Implement input validation for security
4. Then proceed with architecture improvements
