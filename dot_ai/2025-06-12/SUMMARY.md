  - Plan created: `.ai/2025-06-12/tasks/fix-e2e-port-configuration.md`
  - Next steps: Implement fixes for Playwright and Cypress E2E configurations to respect custom port
  - Goal: Ensure all E2E test runners (Playwright, Cypress) respect the --port option from React app generator

## Completed

*(No completed tasks yet)*

## Notes

The --port option was added to @nx/react:app generator but E2E configurations (Playwright and Cypress) are not respecting this port. The vite implementation is already working correctly and will be used as reference.
