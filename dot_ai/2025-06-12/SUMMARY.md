- [x] Fix E2E Port Configuration for React App Generator (2025-06-12 00:00)
  - Plan created: `tasks/fix-e2e-port-configuration.md`
  - Goal: Ensure all E2E test runners (Playwright, Cypress) respect the --port option from React app generator
  - **Accomplishments:**
    - Fixed Vite preview server configuration to use custom port
    - Updated E2E base URL configuration for all bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Rspack, Rsbuild)
    - Added comprehensive unit tests for all bundler + E2E runner combinations
    - Modified 6 core files to ensure port configuration flows correctly
    - All 96 unit tests passing
  - **Result:** Successfully implemented port configuration support across all E2E runners

## In Progress

- [ ] MCP Server Improvements (2025-06-12)
  - Plan created: `tasks/mcp-server-improvements.md`
  - Goal: Implement architecture and performance improvements to MCP AI Content Server
  - **Next Steps:**
    - Fix critical race conditions in directory monitoring
    - Add proper error handling and input validation
    - Implement incremental indexing for performance
    - Add comprehensive test coverage

## Key Technical Improvements

1. **Security**: Enforced environment variable requirement for API keys, preventing accidental exposure
2. **Reliability**: Fixed error handling issues that could cause server crashes
3. **Maintainability**: Modularized code structure for easier future enhancements
4. **Observability**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Test Coverage**: Added unit tests for E2E port configuration across multiple bundlers

## Strategic Focus

Today's work centered on two main themes:
1. **Nx AI Integration Strategy**: Developed comprehensive plan to position Nx as essential tool for AI-assisted development through native MCP support
2. **Code Quality & Security**: Improved production readiness of MCP-related tools with security fixes and better error handling

## Notes

- The Nx AI MCP integration proposal represents a significant strategic opportunity to drive Nx adoption beyond monorepo users
- MCP-Gemini server underwent major improvements based on Gemini's code review, addressing all critical security vulnerabilities
- E2E port configuration fix resolves long-standing issue affecting React app generation with custom ports
