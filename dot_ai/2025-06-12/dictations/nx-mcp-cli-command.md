# Nx MCP CLI Command Specification

## Overview

This note outlines the proposed `nx mcp` command that would be built into the core Nx CLI package.

## Command Structure

```bash
nx mcp [options]
```

## Core Functionality

### Standard MCP Server Mode
- Starts an stdio-based MCP server
- No additional dependencies required
- Ready for immediate integration with:
  - VS Code
  - Cursor
  - Claude Desktop
  - Other MCP-compatible tools

### Key Features

1. **Zero Configuration**
   - Works out of the box after installing Nx
   - No separate package installation needed
   - Automatically detects workspace structure

2. **Context Packaging**
   - Packages workspace metadata
   - Includes project dependencies
   - Provides build/test configurations
   - Exports cache analysis data

3. **AI Tool Integration**
   - Exposes Nx graph data
   - Provides project relationships
   - Shares task dependencies
   - Enables intelligent code navigation

## Example Usage

```bash
# Start MCP server
nx mcp

# With specific port (if not using stdio)
nx mcp --port 3333

# With compression for large workspaces
nx mcp --compress

# Output workspace context to file (for debugging)
nx mcp --output workspace-context.xml
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Immediate Value**: Users get AI integration without additional setup
2. **Growth Driver**: Attracts non-monorepo users to Nx
3. **Ecosystem Play**: Positions Nx as essential for AI-assisted development
4. **Low Barrier**: Simple command, powerful results

## Technical Considerations

- Built on MCP protocol standards
- Leverages existing Nx graph infrastructure
- Minimal overhead when not in use
- Extensible for future AI capabilities
