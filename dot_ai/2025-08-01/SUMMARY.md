# Summary for 2025-08-01

## Tasks

### Completed

- **PTO Calendar Analysis** (18:30)
  - Task: Analyze PTO data from Google Calendar for engineering team
  - Created multiple analysis scripts and reports:
    - `analyze-pto-calendar.mjs` - Initial June-August analysis
    - `analyze-pto-full-year.mjs` - Complete January-August analysis
    - `check-non-engineers.mjs` - Helper to identify non-engineering staff
  - Generated comprehensive reports:
    - `pto-analysis-full-year.json` - Complete data with 324 total PTO days
    - `pto-summary-2025.md` - Executive summary with insights
  - Key findings:
    - 324 engineering person-days of PTO across 8 months
    - July peak month with 60 days
    - Average 40.5 days per month
    - Top users: Chau T. (34 days), Jack H. (29 days)

- **Created PTO Analysis Command Documentation** 
  - Created `/Users/jack/projects/dot-ai-config/dot_claude/commands/pto-summarize.md`
  - Documented complete process for analyzing PTO from Google Calendar
  - Includes step-by-step instructions, code structure, and best practices

- **Fixed PTO Data Issues** 
  - Added Patrick M.'s May vacation (May 2-21, 2025) - 20 days
  - Removed Victor R. from all data (not an employee)
  - Updated totals: 332 PTO days (was 324)
  - May is now peak month with 64 days

- **Added Manual PTO Events Calendar Data**
  - Checked second calendar for June-July 2025
  - Found additional PTO for James H. (5 days in June) and Caleb U. (4 days in June)
  - Updated totals: 341 PTO days (was 332)
  - June now has 51 days (was 42)

- **Debug Cookie Prompt Not Rendering** (16:00)
  - Status: Plan created, ready for implementation
  - Plan: `.ai/2025-08-01/tasks/cookie-prompt-not-rendering.md`
  - Issue: Cookiebot script using Next.js `<Script/>` component not rendering in HTML
  - Created custom Cookiebot templates and styling solutions

- **Nx Patch Release Automation**
  - Created `nx-patch-release.mjs` script for automated cherry-picking
  - Handled failed cherry-picks tracking in `failed-cherry-picks.txt`

## Key Technologies Used

- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for calendar navigation
- **Google Calendar**: Data source for PTO events
- **Node.js/ESM**: Analysis scripts with modern JavaScript
- **Data Analysis**: Set-based deduplication, monthly aggregation

## Insights

- Successfully navigated 8 months of calendar data using Playwright
- Implemented engineering team filtering (21 members)
- Created reusable analysis framework for future PTO tracking
- Identified seasonal patterns: winter recovery, spring dip, summer peak

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Cookiebot implementation following the 5-step plan
2. Monitor patch release automation effectiveness
3. Consider extending PTO analysis to full year when August data is complete
4. Verify if August's low PTO count (2 days) is due to incomplete data
