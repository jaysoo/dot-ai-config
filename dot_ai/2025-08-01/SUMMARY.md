### Completed

(None yet)

## Key Findings

- Cookiebot script is present in `_app.tsx` with `strategy="beforeInteractive"`
- GlobalScripts component waits for Cookiebot to load before initializing analytics
- Issue appears to be that the script is not being rendered at all in the HTML

## Next Steps

1. Start the development server and inspect HTML source
2. Check browser network tab for script loading
3. Test different Script strategies
4. Debug script loading issues
5. Implement and test the fix
