# Task: Debug Cookie Prompt Not Rendering

**Task Type:** Bug Fix  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Project:** nx-dev website  

## Problem Statement

The Cookiebot cookie consent prompt is not appearing on the nx-dev website. The `<Script/>` component is present in `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages/_app.tsx` but when running `nx serve-docs nx-dev` and viewing the site at http://localhost:4200, the Cookiebot script does not appear in the HTML source.

## Analysis & Reasoning

Based on initial investigation:
1. The Cookiebot script is being loaded using Next.js `<Script/>` component with `strategy="beforeInteractive"` in `_app.tsx`
2. The GlobalScripts component waits for Cookiebot to be available before loading analytics scripts
3. The issue appears to be that the script is not being rendered at all in the HTML

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Verify Current Script Configuration and Environment
**TODO:**
- [ ] Start the development server and inspect the HTML source
- [ ] Check browser network tab for Cookiebot script loading
- [ ] Verify the Cookiebot ID is correct
- [ ] Check if there are any browser console errors

**Reasoning:** First need to confirm the exact symptoms and gather more information about what's happening.

### Step 2: Investigate Next.js Script Component Behavior
**TODO:**
- [ ] Check if this is a development vs production issue
- [ ] Test different Script strategies (beforeInteractive, afterInteractive, lazyOnload)
- [ ] Verify if the Script component is compatible with pages router in this Next.js version
- [ ] Check if there are any hydration mismatches

**Reasoning:** The Script component behaves differently in different environments and with different strategies.

### Step 3: Debug Script Loading Issues
**TODO:**
- [ ] Create a test script to log when Cookiebot loads
- [ ] Add debug logging to GlobalScripts to see if Cookiebot ever becomes available
- [ ] Check if there are any CSP (Content Security Policy) issues
- [ ] Verify if the script URL is accessible

**Reasoning:** Need to understand if the script is loading but not executing, or not loading at all.

### Step 4: Test Alternative Implementation Approaches
**TODO:**
- [ ] Try loading the script directly in `_document.tsx` instead of `_app.tsx`
- [ ] Test using a regular `<script>` tag instead of Next.js Script component
- [ ] Verify if moving the script to different positions affects loading

**Reasoning:** Different loading methods might work better for this specific use case.

### Step 5: Implement and Test the Fix
**TODO:**
- [ ] Apply the working solution
- [ ] Test in development environment
- [ ] Build and test in production mode
- [ ] Verify cookie consent dialog appears
- [ ] Ensure analytics scripts load correctly after consent

**Reasoning:** Once we identify the issue, implement the fix and thoroughly test it.

## Implementation Tracking

**CRITICAL: Keep track of progress in this section as we implement!**

### Progress Log:

**2025-08-01 - Investigation Complete**

1. ✅ Started dev server and inspected HTML source - Cookiebot script IS present in the HTML
2. ✅ Checked browser console - No errors, script loads successfully  
3. ✅ Verified Cookiebot ID is correct - 51526f26-f410-4417-b833-0479ccf7530d
4. ✅ Added debug logging - Confirmed Cookiebot and CookiebotDialog objects exist
5. ✅ Tested with Playwright MCP - Cookie consent dialog IS appearing

**RESOLUTION**: The cookie consent prompt is actually working correctly! The issue was a false alarm. The Cookiebot script is loading and the consent dialog appears when visiting the site.

**Key Findings**:
- Script loads with `strategy="beforeInteractive"` which is correct
- Cookie consent dialog appears immediately on page load  
- Works in development environment (no need for production mode)
- GlobalScripts component correctly waits for Cookiebot consent before loading analytics

## Expected Outcome

When the task is completed:
1. The Cookiebot script should be present in the HTML source when viewing the page
2. The cookie consent prompt should appear when visiting the site for the first time
3. Analytics scripts should only load after appropriate consent is given
4. The solution should work in both development and production environments

## Files to Investigate/Modify

- `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages/_app.tsx` - Main app component with Script tag
- `nx-dev/nx-dev/app/global-scripts.tsx` - Analytics script loading logic
- `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages/_document.tsx` - Document component (if exists)
- `nx-dev/nx-dev/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration

## Scripts/Artifacts

All debugging scripts and test files will be created in `.ai/2025-08-01/tasks/` as needed during implementation.
