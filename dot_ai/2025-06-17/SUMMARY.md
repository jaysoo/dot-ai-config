# Summary for 2025-06-17

## Overview
Today focused on improving Nx documentation through systematic GitHub issue analysis, creating developer resources, and documenting the Notion incident management consolidation. Successfully identified 10 easy-to-fix documentation issues, implemented fixes for 3 of them, created a concise RawDocs developer guide, and summarized the migration of 22+ incident management pages into a single consolidated page.

### Fix Angular Module Resolution in Migrate UI
- **Time**: 08:41
- **Description**: Fixed module resolution errors when running Angular migrations through VS Code's Migrate UI
- **Results**:
  - Identified root cause: migrations run without proper working directory context
  - Tried 6 different approaches before finding the simple solution
  - Final fix: just `process.chdir(workspacePath)` with proper restoration
  - Single change fixed both module resolution and Angular file path issues
- **Files Modified**:
  - `libs/vscode/migrate/src/lib/commands/run-migration.ts` - Added working directory change
- **Files Created**:
  - `tasks/fix-angular-module-resolution-migrate-ui.md` - Comprehensive task documentation
