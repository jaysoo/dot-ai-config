2. **Close issues with workarounds** (23 issues)
   - Acknowledge community workarounds
   - Close with appreciation and invitation to reopen if critical

### Phase 2: Documentation Sprint (1-2 weeks)
1. **Address documentation gaps** (180 issues)
   - Group by topic (migration, configuration, setup)
   - Create batch PRs for documentation updates
   - Incorporate community workarounds into official docs

### Phase 3: Dependency & Configuration (2-4 weeks)

   - Many may be resolved in latest versions
   - Create compatibility matrix documentation
   
2. **Configuration issues** (76 issues)

## Automation Opportunities

1. **Auto-close stale issues**: Implement GitHub Action to close issues >6 months with no activity
2. **Documentation bot**: Auto-suggest documentation links for common questions
3. **Reproduction validator**: Bot to verify reproduction repos are accessible
