# Task Plan: Find 5 Easy GitHub Issues (< 100 LOC Changes)

## Task Overview
Analyze Nx GitHub issues and identify 5 issues that can be fixed with minimal code changes (< 100 LOC). Focus on documentation issues and other straightforward fixes. Verify the approach with Gemini before proceeding.

## Reference
- Requested to use @dot_ai/2025-06-16/tasks/nx-easy-issues-validated.md (file not found, proceeding without it)

## Steps

### Step 1: Query GitHub Issues
**Reasoning**: First, we need to get a list of open issues, focusing on docs and "good first issue" labels.

**Actions**:
1. Query docs-related issues
2. Query "good first issue" labeled issues  
3. Query bugs that seem simple

**TODO**:
- [ ] Create script to efficiently query multiple issue categories
- [ ] Filter for issues with clear scope
- [ ] Analyze issue complexity

### Step 2: Analyze Issue Complexity
**Reasoning**: We need to assess each issue to determine if it can be fixed with < 100 LOC.

**Criteria**:
- Documentation fixes (typos, clarifications, broken links)
- Simple configuration updates
- Minor bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Small feature additions with limited scope

**TODO**:
- [ ] Read issue descriptions and comments
- [ ] Check if reproduction steps are provided
- [ ] Estimate LOC impact
- [ ] Filter to top 5 candidates

### Step 3: Create Analysis Summary
**Reasoning**: Document the 5 selected issues with clear reasoning for why they're suitable.

**Format**:
```markdown
## Issue #NUMBER: Title
- **Type**: docs/bug/feature
- **Estimated LOC**: X
- **What needs to be done**: Brief description
- **Why it's easy**: Reasoning
```

**TODO**:
- [ ] Create structured summary for each issue
- [ ] Include issue links and context
- [ ] Note any potential blockers

### Step 4: Verify with Gemini
**Reasoning**: Use Gemini to double-check our understanding of the issues and proposed fixes.

**Questions for Gemini**:
1. Does my understanding of what's being asked match the issue description?
2. Is my proposed approach correct?
3. Are there any edge cases I'm missing?
4. Is my LOC estimate reasonable?

**TODO**:
- [ ] Prepare verification prompt for Gemini
- [ ] Get Gemini's feedback
- [ ] Update analysis based on feedback

## Expected Outcome
A validated list of 5 GitHub issues that:
1. Can be fixed with < 100 LOC changes
2. Have clear scope and requirements
3. Are verified by Gemini for accuracy
4. Include a clear implementation approach

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Steps:
- [x] Created script to query GitHub issues
- [x] Filtered for docs and easy issues
- [x] Analyzed issue complexity
- [x] Created analysis summary with 5 selected issues
- [ ] Verify with Gemini (MCP server not available, skipping)

### Results:
Successfully identified 5 easy documentation issues that can be fixed with < 100 LOC:
1. #31431: Add Bun to CI deployment docs (5-10 LOC)
2. #30649: Explain "*" version meaning (10-15 LOC)
3. #30768: Standardize plugin location guidance (20-30 LOC)
4. #30831: Fix indexHtmlTransformer docs (5-10 LOC)
5. #31111: Document NX_TUI environment variables (10-15 LOC)

Total estimated LOC: 50-80 lines across all 5 issues
