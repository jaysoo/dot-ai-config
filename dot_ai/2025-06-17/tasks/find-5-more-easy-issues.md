# Task Plan: Find 5 More Easy GitHub Issues (< 100 LOC Changes)

## Task Overview
Analyze additional Nx GitHub issues beyond the first 5 already identified to find 5 more issues that can be fixed with minimal code changes (< 100 LOC).

## Already Identified Issues to Exclude
- #31431, #30649, #30768, #30831, #31111

## Steps

### Step 1: Review Existing Data
**Reasoning**: We already have analyzed issues in our JSON files. Let's find more candidates.

**TODO**:
- [x] Review analyzed-easy-issues.json for remaining candidates
- [ ] Look at github-issues-raw.json for issues we haven't analyzed yet
- [ ] Query for additional issues if needed

### Step 2: Analyze Additional Issues
**Reasoning**: Focus on the next set of low-complexity issues from our existing data.

**TODO**:
- [ ] Get detailed information for additional issue numbers
- [ ] Analyze complexity and estimate LOC
- [ ] Select top 5 candidates

### Step 3: Create Summary
**Reasoning**: Document the 5 additional issues with clear implementation approach.

**TODO**:
- [ ] Create structured summary
- [ ] Include issue links and context
- [ ] Note estimated LOC for each

## Expected Outcome
A list of 5 additional GitHub issues that:
1. Can be fixed with < 100 LOC changes
2. Are different from the first 5 already identified
3. Have clear scope and requirements
4. Include documentation or simple code fixes

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Steps:
- [x] Reviewed existing analyzed issues
- [x] Created script to analyze additional issues
- [x] Fetched detailed information for 8 more issues
- [x] Selected top 5 based on complexity
- [x] Created detailed summary with accurate LOC estimates

### Results:
Successfully identified 5 more easy documentation issues:
1. #30137: Fix --dryRun flag documentation (5-10 LOC)
2. #30810: Add E2E encryption verification guide (20-30 LOC)
3. #31398: Clarify ciMode enablement (15-25 LOC)
4. #30058: Add Homebrew troubleshooting (15-20 LOC)
5. #30008: Update Tailwind v4 docs (30-50 LOC)

Total estimated LOC: 85-135 lines
