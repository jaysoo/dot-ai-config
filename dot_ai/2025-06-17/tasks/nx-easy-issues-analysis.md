# Nx Easy Issues Analysis Plan

## Objective
Identify GitHub issues in the `nrwl/nx` repository that are suitable for automated fixes or closure with minimal human intervention.

## Process Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch open issues from the past year using GitHub CLI
2. **Analysis**: Score issues based on predefined criteria to identify "easy" ones
3. **Classification**: Group issues by theme (documentation, stale, workaround, etc.)
4. **Action Suggestions**: Propose specific AI actions for each issue

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set Date Range
- Default to past year of issues
- Use dynamic date calculation for flexibility

### Step 2: Fetch Issues with GitHub CLI
- Retrieve all open issues with metadata
- Include comments, labels, reactions for comprehensive analysis

### Step 3: Run Analysis Script
- Score issues based on positive/negative criteria
- Filter for issues with score â‰¥ 4 (indicating they're "easy")
- Group by primary theme

### Step 4: Generate Reports
- Create JSON output with detailed analysis
- Generate markdown summaries by theme
- Propose specific actions for AI automation
