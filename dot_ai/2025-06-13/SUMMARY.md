# Summary for 2025-06-13

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Incident Response Documentation Audit (09:30 - 10:05) ✅
Successfully completed a comprehensive audit of all Notion incident response documentation, creating a detailed inventory and analysis that will guide future improvements.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **incident_response_pages.md** - Complete inventory with 23 pages and 3 databases, including full page hierarchy
- **expanded-keywords.md** - 100+ incident response keywords organized by category
- **incident-response-audit.md** - Detailed execution plan with progress tracking

**Major Findings:**
- Documentation split across Nx Cloud and Nx CLI workspaces (fragmentation issue)
- BetterStack is the primary incident management tool (not PagerDuty/Opsgenie)
- Strong postmortem culture with consistent templates
- Critical gaps: No IRP document, missing communication protocols, no severity classification
- Duplicate pages: "Incidents" vs "Incident reports" need consolidation
- Naming inconsistencies: "PostMortem" vs "Postmortem", mixed date formats

**Process Innovations:**
- Used 4 parallel subagents for efficient Notion searching
- Integrated Gemini for keyword expansion (6→100+ terms) and expert review
- Added full page hierarchy mapping for better navigation understanding

### 2. @reflect Command Specification Development
Created comprehensive specification for a new Claude command to maintain living architecture documentation.

**Key Features Designed:**
- Auto-detection of repository based on .git root
- Initial scan of 3 months of commit history
- Smart content extraction from .ai files
- Duplicate prevention with section updates
- Quiet mode by default with verbose option

**Problem Solved:**
Addresses the challenge of lost design decisions, forgotten file relationships, and disconnected task tracking in large monorepos like NX.

### 3. Incident Response Cleanup Planning
Developed comprehensive cleanup plan to transition from BetterStack to Grafana IRM.

**Cleanup Scope:**
- Analyze 19 Notion pages for DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE actions
- Remove all BetterStack references
- Establish Grafana IRM as primary incident/alert/on-call tool
- Consolidate duplicate pages into unified structure
- Create new documentation for Grafana IRM workflows

**Planned Structure:**
- Single workspace under Nx Cloud > AREAS > Incident Response
- Consistent naming conventions (Postmortem, YYYY-MM-DD dates)
- Integrated databases linking incidents to postmortems
- Native Notion templates replacing Google Docs

## Technical Insights

1. **Notion API Integration**: Successfully mapped parent-child relationships across Notion workspaces to build complete hierarchy
2. **Content Analysis Approach**: Identified 6 major categories of inconsistencies requiring remediation
3. **Maturity Assessment**: Organization at Level 2/5 (Repeatable) - has basic processes but lacks standardization

## Next Steps Identified

1. **Immediate Actions for Incident Response:**
   - Merge duplicate pages (Incidents + Incident reports)
   - Standardize naming conventions across all pages
   - Move postmortems from Nx CLI to Nx Cloud workspace
   - Create native Notion templates (replace Google Docs)

2. **Future Implementation:**
   - Build @reflect command based on specification
   - Create unified incident response guide
   - Establish cross-references between incidents and postmortems

## Impact Summary

Today's audit provides a clear roadmap for improving incident response documentation, addressing years of organic growth that led to fragmentation and inconsistencies. The structured analysis will enable systematic improvements rather than ad-hoc fixes.

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Implement heap usage logging feature - Enable `NX_LOG_HEAP_USAGE=true` to display peak RSS memory usage
- [ ] Retrieve Notion Incident Response Pages - Export 19 Notion pages to local markdown for cleanup analysis
- [ ] Track Nx Docs Restructure Issue - Monitor GitHub issue #31546 for community feedback and new ideas

## Architecture Documentation Updates

### Console Repository Architecture (11:57)
Performed initial scan of console repository with 6 months of commit history, focusing on migrate UI features.

**Created Architecture Documentation:**
- **console-architecture.md** - Comprehensive repository architecture including:
  - Directory structure overview
  - Migrate UI feature documentation with recent enhancements
  - Personal work history from commits (2025-04-25 to 2025-04-28)
  - Design decisions and technology stack
  - Development patterns and guidelines

**Key Architectural Insights:**
- Migrate UI uses XState for complex state management
- Webview architecture reuses Nx's graph UI infrastructure
- Recent undo-migration feature adds reversal capability for migrations
- Strong separation between VS Code and IntelliJ implementations

**Files Analyzed:**
- 2 commits from last 6 months (undo-migration feature, Nx upgrade)
- 13 migrate-related TypeScript files in libs/vscode/migrate/
- Existing .ai directory structure with daily summaries and tasks

### 5. Heap Usage Logging Implementation Plan (16:00)
Created comprehensive implementation plan for adding memory tracking to Nx task execution.

**Plan Deliverables:**
- **implement-heap-logging.md** - Detailed 9-step implementation plan with TODO tracking
- **test-heap-logging.mjs** - Automated test script for verifying implementation
- **memory-test-script.mjs** - Helper script for creating memory-intensive test scenarios

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use pidusage library for cross-platform memory tracking
- Add peakRss field to Task interface
- Integrate tracking in RunningNodeProcess class
- Thread memory data through task orchestrator to terminal output
- Display format: `✔ nx run myapp:build (2.5s) (peak: 256MB)`

**Testing Strategy:**
- Publish test versions (23.0.0-test.1, test.2, etc.)
- Create test workspace with memory-intensive tasks
- Verify peak RSS displays with NX_LOG_HEAP_USAGE=true
- Ensure no impact when environment variable not set
