# Summary for 2025-06-13

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Heap Usage Logging Feature Implementation ✅
Successfully implemented memory tracking for Nx task execution, enabling developers to identify memory-intensive operations with `NX_LOG_HEAP_USAGE=true`.

**Deliverables:**
- **memory-tracker.ts** - New cross-platform memory tracking service using pidusage
- Modified 13 core Nx files to integrate memory tracking throughout task execution
- Display format: `✔ nx run myapp:build (2.5s) (peak: 256MB)`
- Only activates with environment variable to avoid performance impact

**Key Features:**
- Tracks entire process tree including child processes
- 100ms polling interval for accurate peak memory capture
- Human-readable memory display (KB, MB, GB)
- Graceful fallback for cached tasks and pseudo-terminal

### 2. Incident Response Documentation Audit ✅
Completed comprehensive audit of Notion incident response documentation, providing clear roadmap for BetterStack → Grafana IRM migration.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **incident_response_pages.md** - Complete inventory: 23 pages, 3 databases with full hierarchy
- **incident-response-cleanup-plan.md** - Detailed migration plan with page-by-page actions
- **grafana-irm-content-updates.md** - New content for all incident response pages
- Retrieved and backed up all 19 Notion pages locally for analysis

**Major Findings:**
- Maturity Level: 2/5 (Repeatable) - has processes but lacks standardization
- Critical gaps: No IRP document, missing severity classification, no communication protocols
- Tool ecosystem: BetterStack (status page), Grafana IRM (alerting), Linear (DR exercises)
- Strong postmortem culture but fragmented across workspaces

### 3. Incident Response Documentation Updates (Partial) ⚠️
Updated Notion incident response pages to transition from BetterStack to Grafana IRM.

**Completed Updates:**
- Main Incident Management page rewritten for Grafana IRM workflow
- Merged Incident Response Guidelines content into main page
- Renamed "Incidents" database to "Postmortems" 
- Archived process setup page and 2 of 3 "New Incident" templates

**Incomplete Items:**
- Several pages marked for deletion still exist
- Database schema not updated with new fields
- Postmortems page not updated with new content
- Status page URL remains status.nx.app (not changed to .dev)

**Created:** **final-incident-page-changes.md** - Complete diff of planned vs actual changes

### 4. Migrate UI Module Resolution Debug Plan
Created comprehensive debugging strategy for VS Code extension module resolution issues.

**Problem:** Migrations fail to find node_modules when run through UI but work in terminal.

**Deliverables:**
- **debug-migrate-ui-module-resolution.md** - 5-step investigation plan
- **debug-module-paths.mjs** - Module resolution analysis script
- **test-migration.js** - Reproduction migration for testing
- **compare-execution-contexts.mjs** - Environment comparison tool
- **proposed-fix-node-path.ts** - Potential solution code

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** Different working directory or missing NODE_PATH when spawning migration process from VS Code.

### 5. Architecture Documentation (@reflect Command Spec)
Designed new Claude command for maintaining living architecture documentation in monorepos.

**Specification:** **reflect-command.md** - Comprehensive design for @reflect command

**Key Features:**
- Auto-detects repository based on .git root
- Scans 3 months of commit history by default
- Extracts content from .ai daily folders
- Updates existing sections to prevent duplicates
- Creates console-architecture.md for Nx Console repository

**Problem Solved:** Lost design decisions and forgotten file relationships in large codebases.

### 6. Nx Docs Restructure Tracking
Documented intentional docs restructure issue for monitoring.

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/31546
- Status: Intentional change, user answered
- Action: Monitor for community feedback and new ideas
- Created: **nx-docs-restructure-tracking.md**

## Technical Deep Dives

### Memory Tracking Implementation Details
- Used pidusage library for cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Singleton pattern with getMemoryTracker() factory
- 100ms polling balances accuracy vs performance
- Process tree tracking captures child process memory
- Cleanup prevents leaks with pidusage.clear()

### Notion API Integration Insights
- Successfully mapped parent-child relationships across workspaces
- Used parallel subagents for efficient page searching
- Built complete hierarchy from fragmented documentation
- Created local backup system for all incident pages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Complete incident response page cleanup (delete remaining pages)
2. Update database schema with new postmortem fields
3. Test heap logging in production scenarios
4. Debug migrate UI module resolution issue

### Future Implementation:
1. Build @reflect command based on specification
2. Add tests and documentation for heap logging
3. Complete Grafana IRM migration
4. Support ForkedProcessTaskRunner for memory tracking

## Impact Summary

Today's work significantly improved Nx developer experience with memory visibility and laid groundwork for modernizing incident response processes. The heap logging feature addresses a long-standing need for memory optimization insights, while the incident response audit provides a clear path to operational excellence.
