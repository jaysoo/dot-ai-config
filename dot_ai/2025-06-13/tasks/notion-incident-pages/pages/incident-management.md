# Incident Management

## Updating the status page

If there is either a confirmed or suspected incident, update the [status page](https://status.nx.app/) as soon as possible.

> ðŸ’¬ All service status changes should be done via reports, so we can provide historical info when pointing people to the status page for the outage times.

1. Create a new status report on BetterStack: https://uptime.betterstack.com/team/86648/status-pages/153609/reports
   - ![Navigate to the status pages > status.nx.app page, then click "create status report"](image-placeholder)

2. Describe which services are affected, and what we're doing to fix it (or that we're investigating the issue)

3. Try to post updated every 30-45 minutes as the issue persist. If nothing has changed, repeat something along the lines of "The team is still investigating the issue which is impacting some customers trying to <some operation>. We will update when we have more information"

4. Update the status report to resolve all impacted services when a fix has been released

### Example

> Nx API timeouts
