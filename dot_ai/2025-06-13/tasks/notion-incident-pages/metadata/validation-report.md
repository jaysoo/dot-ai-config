## Key Findings

### BetterStack References Found
- **Incident Management page**: Contains explicit instructions to use BetterStack for status reporting
- URL: https://uptime.betterstack.com/team/86648/status-pages/153609/reports

### Structural Issues
1. **Duplicate Pages**: "Incidents" vs "Incident reports" - both exist separately
2. **Template Confusion**: Multiple "New Incident" entries in database
3. **External Dependencies**: Incident Report Template links to Google Docs instead of native Notion
4. **Naming Inconsistencies**: "PostMortem" vs "Postmortem" variations

### Missing Elements
1. No severity classification in incidents database
2. No link between incidents and postmortems
3. No SLA tracking fields
4. No business impact metrics

## Recommendations for Cleanup

### DELETE (5 pages)
- Incidents page (redundant with Incident reports)
- New Incident template entries (3x)
- Incident management process setup (merge into main)

### UPDATE (14 pages)
- All pages with BetterStack references → Grafana IRM
- Incident Report Template → Convert from Google Docs to Notion
- Database schemas → Add severity, SLA, impact fields
- Naming standardization → "Postmortem" consistently

### MERGE (3 actions)
- Combine duplicate incident tracking pages
- Link incidents database with postmortems
- Consolidate disaster recovery pages

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed analysis file for each page
2. Document specific BetterStack → Grafana IRM changes
3. Design new consolidated structure
4. Plan migration sequence
