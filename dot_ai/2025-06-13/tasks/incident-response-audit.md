# Incident Response Documentation Audit Plan

## Task Overview
Audit all Notion pages and databases related to incident response to create a comprehensive inventory for future analysis of inconsistencies, duplicates, and content gaps.

## Approach
Use multiple subagents working in parallel to efficiently search and document all incident response related content in Notion.

## Steps

### Step 1: Keyword Discovery and Expansion
**TODO:**
- [x] Use Gemini via subagent to brainstorm additional incident response keywords
- [x] Compile comprehensive keyword list

**Initial Keywords:**
- Incident Response
- On-call
- Incident Management
- Betterstack
- IRM (Incident Response Management)
- Mitigation

**Reasoning:** Starting with provided keywords and expanding the list ensures comprehensive coverage. Gemini can help identify industry-standard terms and variations we might miss.

### Step 2: Notion Content Search
**TODO:**
- [x] Create subagent tasks for searching Notion with different keyword groups
- [x] Search both pages and databases
- [x] Capture page IDs, URLs, titles

**Search Strategy:**
- Divide keywords into logical groups for parallel searching
- Use both exact matches and partial matches
- Search in titles, content, and database properties

**Reasoning:** Parallel subagents will speed up the search process while ensuring thorough coverage.

### Step 3: Content Summary Generation
**TODO:**
- [x] For each found page, create concise content summaries
- [x] Note key topics covered
- [x] Identify page type (process doc, runbook, policy, etc.)

**Summary Format:**
```markdown
## [Page Title]
- **URL:** [Notion URL]
- **Author:** [Names, if available]
- **Type:** [Process/Runbook/Policy/Database/etc.]
- **Summary:** [2-3 sentence summary]
- **Key Topics:** [Bullet list of main topics]
- **Last Updated:** [If available]
```

**Reasoning:** Structured summaries will facilitate later analysis for duplicates and gaps.

### Step 4: Results Compilation
**TODO:**
- [x] Compile all findings into `incident_response_pages.md`
- [x] Organize by category or type
- [x] Include metadata and statistics

**Reasoning:** A well-organized output file will be essential for the next phase of analysis.

### Step 5: Gemini Review
**TODO:**
- [x] Use Gemini via subagent to review the compiled list
- [x] Get feedback on completeness
- [x] Identify potential missing areas
- [x] Add Gemini's insights to the document

**Reasoning:** External review helps validate our findings and identify blind spots.

## Implementation Notes

### Subagent Task Structure
Each subagent should:
1. Take a specific set of keywords
2. Search Notion comprehensively
3. Return structured results
4. Handle pagination for large result sets

### Output File Structure
`incident_response_pages.md` should include:
1. Executive summary with statistics
2. Categorized page listings
3. Full page details with summaries
4. Gemini's review and recommendations
5. Next steps for analysis

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion, we will have:
1. A comprehensive inventory of all incident response documentation in Notion
2. Structured summaries of each page's content
3. Metadata for analysis (URLs, types, topics)
4. Expert review from Gemini
5. A foundation for identifying inconsistencies, duplicates, and gaps in the next phase

## CRITICAL: Implementation Tracking
When executing this plan, keep track of progress in this section:
- **Started:** 09:35
- **Keywords Generated:** 100+
- **Pages Found:** 23
- **Databases Found:** 3
- **Summaries Created:** 15
- **Completed:** 10:05

### Progress Log

**Step 1 Completed (09:35)**
- Used Gemini to brainstorm additional keywords
- Expanded from 6 initial keywords to 100+ comprehensive terms
- Categories include: industry terms, tools, acronyms, stages, roles, severity levels

**Step 2 Completed (09:40)**
- Executed 4 parallel subagent searches across keyword categories
- Found 25+ incident-related pages and databases
- Discovered main incident management structure with databases and templates
- Notable findings: Grafana IRM integration, disaster recovery documentation
- Missing elements: No PagerDuty/Opsgenie docs, no SLA/SLO documentation, no on-call schedules

**Step 3 Completed (09:50)**
- Deep-dive analysis of 15 key pages and databases
- Discovered BetterStack as primary incident management tool
- Found well-structured postmortem process with consistent templates
- Identified major gaps in communication protocols and stakeholder management
- DR exercises documented but moved to Linear (fragmentation issue)

**Step 4 Completed (09:55)**
- Compiled comprehensive inventory in `incident_response_pages.md`
- Organized into 8 categories: databases, core management, postmortems, incident reports, DR, tools, etc.
- Added deep-dive analysis with maturity assessment and process flow analysis
- Created detailed recommendations for immediate priorities and consolidation

**Step 5 Completed (10:00)**
- Gemini reviewed findings and provided expert assessment
- Identified critical missing foundation: comprehensive Incident Response Plan (IRP)
- Added 8 additional search areas including security incident, breach response, compliance
- Rated maturity at Level 2/5 (Repeatable) - basic processes but lack standardization
- Recommended NIST CSF alignment and formal risk assessment integration
