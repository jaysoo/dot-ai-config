# Add Heap Log Option for NX CLI

**Task Type:** New Feature  
**Created:** 2025-06-13  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Overview
Add a heap log option to the NX CLI to help with memory diagnostics and debugging. This involves identifying and updating all files related to SME, task running, task orchestration, and process bonding.

## Investigation Approach
1. Use repomix to analyze the NX monorepo structure
2. Consult with Gemini for guidance on implementation
3. Track all examined files for future reference
4. Focus on areas related to:
   - SME (Subject Matter Expert/Shared Memory Engine?)
   - Task running
   - Task orchestration  
   - Process bonding

## Files Being Tracked
*(This section will be continuously updated as we investigate)*

### Core Areas to Investigate
- [ ] NX CLI entry points
- [ ] Task runner implementation
- [ ] Task orchestrator components
- [ ] Process management modules
- [ ] Memory/heap related utilities

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Codebase Analysis
**TODO:**
- [ ] Use repomix to package the NX folder for analysis
- [ ] Identify all CLI command handlers
- [ ] Find task running and orchestration components
- [ ] Locate process bonding implementations
- [ ] Document all relevant files

### Step 2: Identify Integration Points
**TODO:**
- [ ] Find where CLI options are parsed
- [ ] Locate memory/heap monitoring hooks
- [ ] Identify task lifecycle events for heap logging
- [ ] Map process creation and management points

### Step 3: Design Heap Logging Implementation
**TODO:**
- [ ] Define heap log format and output
- [ ] Determine logging triggers (start/end of tasks, intervals, etc.)
- [ ] Plan integration with existing logging infrastructure
- [ ] Consider performance implications

### Step 4: Implementation
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add heap log CLI option
- [ ] Implement heap snapshot/logging utilities
- [ ] Integrate with task runner
- [ ] Add heap logging to orchestrator
- [ ] Update documentation

### Step 5: Testing
**TODO:**
- [ ] Unit tests for heap logging utilities
- [ ] Integration tests with task runner
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] E2E tests for CLI option

## Expected Outcome
When completed, users should be able to run NX CLI commands with a heap log option that provides memory usage insights during task execution, helping with debugging memory-related issues in large monorepos.

## Notes
- CRITICAL: Keep track of all files examined and modified in this document
- Use Gemini for architectural guidance and code review
- Ensure minimal performance impact when heap logging is disabled
