# Incident Response Documentation Cleanup Plan

**Date:** 2025-06-13  
**Duration:** 1 day (8 hours)  
**Goal:** Clean up incident response docs, remove BetterStack, establish Grafana IRM as primary tool

## Quick Summary

We're going to:
1. Generate 19 markdown files analyzing each Notion page
2. Mark pages for DELETE, UPDATE, or MERGE
3. Remove ALL BetterStack references
4. Document Grafana IRM as our incident/alert/on-call tool
5. Create consolidated structure

## Work Breakdown

### Phase 1: Page Analysis (3 hours)

**What:** Create one markdown file per Notion page (19 total)

**Each file contains:**
- Current page info (URL, author, last updated)
- Content summary
- Issues found (BetterStack mentions, outdated info)
- Recommendation: DELETE, UPDATE, or MERGE
- Specific changes needed
- Where it belongs in new structure

**Pages to analyze:**
1. Incident Management (Main) - UPDATE (remove BetterStack, add Grafana IRM)
2. Incidents page - DELETE (redundant)
3. Incident reports - UPDATE (consolidation target)
4. Incident Report Template - UPDATE (move from Google Docs)
5. Incident management process setup - MERGE (into main page)
6. Incidents database - UPDATE (add severity, SLA fields)
7. Postmortems main - UPDATE (move to Nx Cloud)
8. Prior Postmortems database - UPDATE (link to incidents)
9. 5 individual postmortems - UPDATE (standardize names)
10. 3 incident reports - UPDATE (ensure no BetterStack)
11. 3 disaster recovery pages - UPDATE (bring back from Linear)
12. New Incident page - DELETE (unclear purpose)

### Phase 2: Content Generation (3 hours)

**What:** Create new consolidated documentation

**Files to generate:**
1. `incident-response-overview.md` - Master doc with Grafana IRM workflows
2. `grafana-irm-setup.md` - How we use Grafana for incidents/alerts/on-call
3. `on-call-procedures.md` - Rotation schedules, handoffs
4. `escalation-matrix.md` - Who to call when (P0-P3 severity)
5. `communication-templates.md` - Pre-written messages

**New structure:**
```
Incident Response/
├── Overview (with Grafana IRM)
├── Active Incidents (database)
├── Postmortems (database)
├── Processes/
│   ├── Alert Management (Grafana)
│   ├── On-Call Management (Grafana)
│   ├── Escalation Procedures
│   └── Communication Protocols
├── Disaster Recovery/
└── Resources/
    ├── Runbooks
    └── Templates
```

### Phase 3: Process Documentation (2 hours)

**What:** Document how things actually work

**Tasks:**
1. Map current incident flow with Grafana IRM
2. Document alert routing rules
3. Capture on-call schedules
4. Define severity levels (P0-P3)
5. Create implementation guide for team

## Decision Rules

**DELETE if:**
- Page is redundant
- Purpose is unclear
- Content exists elsewhere

**UPDATE if:**
- Contains BetterStack (remove it)
- Missing Grafana IRM info (add it)
- Naming inconsistent (fix it)

**MERGE if:**
- Content belongs in another page
- Creates cleaner structure

## Key Principles

1. **Zero BetterStack** - Any mention gets removed
2. **Grafana IRM everywhere** - It's our tool for incidents, alerts, on-call
3. **One workspace** - Everything under Nx Cloud > AREAS > Incident Response
4. **Consistent naming** - "Postmortem" (not PostMortem), YYYY-MM-DD dates
5. **Match reality** - Docs must reflect actual processes

## Deliverables

1. **19 page analysis files** in `incident-response-pages/`
2. **5 new documentation files** for consolidated content
3. **1 implementation guide** for the team
4. **0 BetterStack references** remaining
5. **1 unified structure** with Grafana IRM
