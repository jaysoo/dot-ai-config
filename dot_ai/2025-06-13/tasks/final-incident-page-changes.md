**Page URL:** https://www.notion.so/Incident-Management-462453a4546340b8820c5d9d9ba74892  
**Date Updated:** 2025-06-13

### Summary of Changes

The page has been completely rewritten, transitioning from BetterStack-focused documentation to Grafana IRM-based incident management. Key changes include:

1. **Tool Migration**: BetterStack ‚Üí Grafana IRM as primary incident management tool
2. **Status Page URL**: Remains status.nx.app (not changed to status.nx.dev as planned)
3. **Structure**: Changed from step-by-step status update instructions to comprehensive incident response process
4. **Content**: Removed all BetterStack references and added Grafana IRM workflows
5. **IMPORTANT**: Content from "Incident Response Guidelines" page (https://www.notion.so/nxnrwl/Incident-Response-Guidelines-72a3a6e9c5bd40e7a1111be11a3e74a6) was merged into this page (Note: Guidelines page was not in original backup)

### Detailed Diff

#### Removed Content:
- All BetterStack-specific instructions for creating status reports
- Step-by-step screenshots and navigation for BetterStack
- Time zone conversion guidance
- Detailed status update templates
- References to BetterStack URLs and interfaces

#### Added Content:

**New Introduction:**
- Clear statement that all incidents are managed through Grafana IRM
- Table of contents for better navigation

**Key Tools Section:**
- Grafana IRM: https://nx.grafana.net/a/grafana-irm-app (with direct link)
- Slack: #grafana_irm channel
- Statuspage: https://manage.statuspage.io/pages/l18ysly7bgt1/incidents
- Notion: For postmortems only

**Alert Monitoring Section:**
- List of what Grafana monitors (503 errors, API downtime, etc.)
- Clear statement that alerts appear in #grafana_irm Slack channel

**On-Call Responsibilities Section:**
- Rotation Schedule details (weekly, ~2 months between rotations)
- On-Call Duties numbered list

**Incident Response Process:**
Organized into clear numbered sections:

1. **Alert Acknowledgment**
   - Check #grafana_irm channel
   - Acknowledge in message thread
   - Assess severity
   - Declare incident ASAP from Slack

2. **Incident Creation**
   - Warning not to create incidents on Statuspage
   - Grafana IRM as source of truth
   - Automatic vs Manual creation
   - Direct link to create incident

3. **Status Page Updates**
   - Note about automatic integration
   - Instructions for setting affected components
   - 30-45 minute update cadence (retained from original)

4. **Investigation & Resolution**
   - Common resolution: restart pods
   - Collaboration with Infra/App teams
   - Resolution process in both Grafana and Statuspage

### Key Differences:

1. **Tone**: More direct and operational vs. previous tutorial style
2. **Links**: Added direct operational links to tools
3. **Process**: Clearer workflow from alert ‚Üí incident ‚Üí resolution
4. **Integration**: Emphasizes Grafana-Statuspage integration
5. **Communication**: Strong focus on Slack channel for coordination

### Notable Retention:
- Status page URL remains status.nx.app (not changed to status.nx.dev)
- 30-45 minute update cadence recommendation
- Basic incident communication templates

### Missing from Planned Updates:
The following content from the planned update document was NOT included:
- Detailed bash commands for pod restarts
- Escalation matrix table
- Postmortem process details
- Quick links section
- Communication protocol details (internal/external/customer)
- Severity levels (P0-P3)
- On-call coverage hours specification

### Current vs. Planned Comparison:
The actual update is significantly shorter and more focused than the comprehensive rewrite planned in the grafana-irm-content-updates.md document. It covers the essential workflow but omits many operational details, reference materials, and process improvements suggested in the plan.
