# Nx Docs Restructure Tracking

## Overview

There's an issue with the updated docs restructure for nx.dev that has been raised by a user.

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/31546

## Current Status

- The restructure is **intentional**
- The user has already been provided with an answer
- Decision: Keep the issue open for monitoring purposes

## Action Plan

We want to keep this issue around for a few days to:
1. See if it gets addressed further
2. Monitor for any new ideas or suggestions from the community
3. Gather additional feedback on the docs restructure

## Next Steps

This should be tracked as a task in TODO.md for visibility and follow-up.
