## Accomplishments

### Nx.dev Sitemap Parsing and Redirect Preparation

Created tooling to parse and prepare redirects for the nx.dev documentation site migration:

- **Sitemap Parser Script** (`parse-sitemap.mjs`): Built a Node.js script to fetch and parse the nx.dev sitemap XML
- **URL Extraction**: Successfully extracted 1,297 unique URLs from the sitemap
- **Redirect Template Generation**: Generated a JavaScript redirect template mapping existing paths to `/docs` prefixed paths for the Astro documentation migration
- **File Organization**: Properly organized all artifacts in `.ai/2025-08-25/tasks/` folder

## Deliverables

1. **parse-sitemap.mjs** - Reusable script for fetching and parsing sitemaps
2. **nx-dev-urls.txt** - Plain text list of all 1,297 URLs from nx.dev
3. **nx-dev-redirects.js** - JavaScript object with redirect mappings ready for customization

## Context

This work supports the ongoing DOC-154 task for fixing URL redirects from nx.dev to the new Astro documentation site. The generated redirect template provides a foundation for ensuring all existing URLs properly redirect to their new locations in the Astro-based documentation.

## Next Steps

- Review and customize the redirect mappings in `nx-dev-redirects.js`
- Continue with DOC-154 redirect implementation and testing
