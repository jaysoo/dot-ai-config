# Redirect Rules Analysis - Corrected Summary for Astro Docs

## Key Finding

**Only 11.4% of the redirect rules are working for the Astro docs migration.**

All 1,078 redirect rules in `redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js` correctly target `/docs/*` URLs (which is correct for Astro docs), but only 123 of those target URLs actually exist on canary.nx.dev.

## The Numbers

| Status | Count | Percentage | Description |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Working** | 123 | 11.4% | Target `/docs/*` URLs that exist |
| ❌ **Broken** | 955 | 88.6% | Target `/docs/*` URLs that don't exist |

## Working Sections (123 URLs)

These sections have their content properly available under `/docs/*`:

- `/docs/concepts/*` - 20 working URLs
- `/docs/technologies/*` - 67 working URLs  
- `/docs/reference/*` - 13 working URLs
- `/docs/features/*` - 10 working URLs
- `/docs/getting-started/*` - 6 working URLs
- `/docs/troubleshooting/*` - 6 working URLs
- `/docs/plugin-registry` - 1 working URL

## Broken Sections (955 URLs)

These sections are missing from `/docs/*` on canary.nx.dev:

### Major Missing Categories:
- `/docs/nx-api/*` - 559 URLs (all API documentation)
- `/docs/reference/commands/*` - 277 URLs (CLI command documentation)
- `/docs/ci/*` - 77 URLs (CI/CD documentation)
- `/docs/recipes/*` - 67 URLs (all recipe documentation)
- `/docs/extending-nx/*` - 27 URLs (plugin development)
- `/docs/deprecated/*` - 17 URLs (deprecated features)
- `/docs/nx-enterprise/*` - 6 URLs (enterprise features)
- `/docs/see-also/*` - 2 URLs

### Partially Missing:
- `/docs/getting-started/*` - 6 URLs missing (tutorials and some guides)
- `/docs/features/*` - 1 URL missing (maintain-ts-monorepos)
- `/docs/concepts/*` - 1 URL missing (nx-daemon)

## The Real Issue

The redirect rules file is correctly structured - all URLs properly map from old paths to `/docs/*` paths. However, **88.6% of the content that should be at `/docs/*` doesn't exist on canary.nx.dev**.

This suggests either:
1. The content hasn't been migrated to the Astro docs yet
2. The content has been reorganized to different locations
3. The content has been intentionally removed

## What Actually Exists on canary.nx.dev

Based on my earlier analysis, much of this content actually exists at root-level paths (NOT under `/docs`):
- `/ci/*` content exists (not `/docs/ci/*`)
- `/recipes/*` content exists (not `/docs/recipes/*`)
- `/extending-nx/*` content exists (not `/docs/extending-nx/*`)
- `/nx-api/*` content has been moved to `/technologies/*/api`

## Recommendation

The redirect rules file appears to be aspirational - it assumes all content will be under `/docs/*` in the Astro migration. To make these redirects work, either:

### Option 1: Move Content to /docs
Migrate all the existing content from root-level paths to under `/docs/*` to match the redirect rules.

### Option 2: Update Redirect Rules
Change the redirect rules to point to where the content actually exists now (mostly at root level, not under `/docs`).

### Option 3: Create New Content
If the Astro docs are meant to be a fresh rewrite, the missing 955 pages need to be created under `/docs/*`.

## Summary

- ✅ **11.4%** of redirects are working (123 URLs)
- ❌ **88.6%** of redirects are broken (955 URLs)
- All redirect rules correctly use `/docs/*` prefix for Astro
- The content just doesn't exist at those `/docs/*` locations yet
