# Final Redirect Validation Summary for canary.nx.dev

Generated: 2025-08-25
Total redirect rules analyzed: 1,078

## Executive Summary

I've validated all 1,078 redirect mappings in `redirect-rules-docs-to-astro.js` to check if their **target URLs** exist on canary.nx.dev.

### Overall Results:
- ✅ **123 mappings (11.4%)** have WORKING target URLs that exist
- ❌ **955 mappings (88.6%)** have BROKEN target URLs (404)

### For the 955 broken mappings:
- ✅ **103 (10.8%)** can be FIXED with alternative URLs that exist
- ⚠️ **59 (6.2%)** need investigation (patterns found but no working alternatives)
- ❌ **793 (83.0%)** have no obvious alternatives

## WORKING REDIRECTS (123 total)

These sections have working target URLs:
- `/docs/technologies/*` - 67 working URLs
- `/docs/concepts/*` - 20 working URLs  
- `/docs/reference/*` - 13 working URLs
- `/docs/features/*` - 10 working URLs
- `/docs/getting-started/*` - 6 working URLs
- `/docs/troubleshooting/*` - 6 working URLs
- `/docs/plugin-registry` - 1 working URL

## BROKEN BUT FIXABLE (103 total)

Found working alternatives for these patterns:
- `/docs/ci/*` → `/ci/*` (76 URLs - CI content is at root level, not under /docs)
- `/docs/extending-nx/*` → `/extending-nx/*` (26 URLs - extending-nx is at root level)
- `/docs/recipes/nx-console/console-troubleshooting` → `/docs/troubleshooting/console-troubleshooting`

### Sample fixes needed:
```javascript
// Current (broken):
"/ci": "/docs/ci",
// Should be:
"/ci": "/ci/getting-started/intro",

// Current (broken):
"/extending-nx": "/docs/extending-nx",
// Should be:
"/extending-nx": "/extending-nx",
```

## BROKEN - NEEDS INVESTIGATION (955 total)

Major broken sections:
1. **All /docs/recipes/** (67 URLs) - Recipe content has been reorganized
2. **All /docs/deprecated/** (17 URLs) - Deprecated content removed
3. **All /docs/nx-api/** (560 URLs) - API docs restructured under /technologies/*/api
4. **Most /docs/technologies/*/recipes/** - Technology-specific recipes missing

## Key Findings

1. **Documentation structure has changed significantly**:
   - CI documentation remains at `/ci/*` not `/docs/ci/*`
   - Extending-nx remains at `/extending-nx/*` not `/docs/extending-nx/*`
   - Recipes have been removed or reorganized
   - API documentation moved to technology-specific sections

2. **Most core documentation exists**:
   - Getting started guides
   - Core concepts
   - Features
   - Technologies overview
   - Reference documentation

3. **Missing content categories**:
   - Recipes (all categories)
   - Deprecated documentation
   - CI documentation under /docs
   - nx-api references

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes (103 URLs)**:
   - Update CI redirects to point to `/ci/*` instead of `/docs/ci/*`
   - Update extending-nx redirects to point to `/extending-nx/*` instead of `/docs/extending-nx/*`
   - Apply the working alternatives found in ALTERNATIVES-REPORT.md

2. **Content migration needed (852 URLs)**:
   - Decide if recipes should be created under /docs/recipes or redirected elsewhere
   - Determine where deprecated content should redirect to
   - Map old nx-api URLs to new technology-specific API pages

3. **Pattern-based redirects**:
   - Consider implementing pattern redirects for common transformations
   - Example: `/nx-api/{tech}/*` → `/technologies/{tech}/api`

## Files Generated

1. **TARGET-URL-REPORT.md** - Detailed breakdown of working vs broken URLs
2. **target-url-validation.csv** - Spreadsheet of all URL validations
3. **ALTERNATIVES-REPORT.md** - Specific alternative URLs that work
4. **alternatives.json** - JSON data of all alternatives found

## Next Steps

1. Apply the 103 fixable redirects immediately
2. Review the 793 URLs with no alternatives to determine if content needs to be created or if different redirects should be used
3. Consider if the redirect structure in the file matches the actual site architecture
