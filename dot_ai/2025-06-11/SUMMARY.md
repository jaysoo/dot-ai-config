# Daily Summary - 2025-06-11

## Overview

Successfully created a one-line installation system for the Raw Docs project, enabling developers to quickly set up documentation tracking in their repositories using GitHub CLI.

## Tasks Completed

### Create Curl-based Installation Script for Raw Docs âœ…
- **Duration**: 10:45 - 11:30
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Plan**: `tasks/curl-install-script.md`

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Created `install.sh` - A comprehensive bash installation script that automates the entire raw-docs setup process
- Implemented intelligent repository detection and validation to ensure proper installation context
- Added automatic npm dependency installation and cross-repository integration
- Solved private repository access challenge by leveraging GitHub CLI instead of traditional curl
- Updated documentation with clear installation instructions

**Technical Highlights:**
- Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux) with OS detection
- Robust error handling with colorful, helpful output
- Environment variable configuration for customization
- Smart update detection for existing installations
- Integration with existing Node.js scripts (`install-hook.mjs`, `install-cross-repo.mjs`)

**Final Solution:**
```bash
# One-line installation via GitHub CLI
gh api repos/nrwl/raw-docs/contents/install.sh --jq '.content' | base64 -d | bash
```

## Additional Work

- **Installation Methods Research**: Documented 5 different approaches for accessing private GitHub repositories (`tasks/installation-methods.md`)
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced README with prerequisites, quick install section, and manual setup alternatives

## Impact

This work significantly reduces the barrier to entry for developers adopting the Raw Docs system. What previously required multiple manual steps and repository cloning can now be accomplished with a single command, improving developer experience and adoption rates.

## Notes

- All 7 planned implementation steps were completed successfully
- Manual testing verified functionality across different scenarios
- The solution maintains backward compatibility while adding new convenience features
- GitHub CLI was chosen as the primary method due to its widespread adoption and seamless authentication handling
