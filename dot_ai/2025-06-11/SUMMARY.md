# Daily Summary - 2025-06-11

## Overview

Completed two major development tasks today: Created a one-line installation system for the Raw Docs project using GitHub CLI, and built a comprehensive documentation-feature correlation tool to help the Nx documentation team track and update docs based on feature changes.

## Tasks Completed

### Create Curl-based Installation Script for Raw Docs âœ…
- **Duration**: 10:45 - 11:30
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Plan**: `tasks/curl-install-script.md`

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Created `install.sh` - A comprehensive bash installation script that automates the entire raw-docs setup process
- Implemented intelligent repository detection and validation to ensure proper installation context
- Added automatic npm dependency installation and cross-repository integration
- Solved private repository access challenge by leveraging GitHub CLI instead of traditional curl
- Updated documentation with clear installation instructions

**Technical Highlights:**
- Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux) with OS detection
- Robust error handling with colorful, helpful output
- Environment variable configuration for customization
- Smart update detection for existing installations
- Integration with existing Node.js scripts (`install-hook.mjs`, `install-cross-repo.mjs`)

**Final Solution:**
```bash
# One-line installation via GitHub CLI
gh api repos/nrwl/raw-docs/contents/install.sh --jq '.content' | base64 -d | bash
```

### Documentation-Feature Correlation Tool âœ…
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Plan**: `tasks/docs-feature-correlation-tool.md`
- **Status**: All 6 implementation steps completed

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Built a comprehensive tool to analyze feature changes and correlate them with documentation that needs updates
- Implemented 5 core components working together:
  - `analyze-feature-changes.mjs` - Extracts git diff changes from features/ directory
  - `scan-nx-docs.mjs` - Scans and indexes Nx documentation
  - `correlate-features-docs.mjs` - Matches features to relevant docs using multiple strategies
  - `generate-update-plan.mjs` - Creates AI-consumable update plans
  - `docs-correlation-tool.mjs` - Main CLI orchestrator

**Technical Highlights:**
- Multi-strategy correlation engine (package matching, keyword analysis, path patterns, content similarity)
- Confidence scoring system for correlation accuracy
- AI-optimized markdown output format for Claude consumption
- Smart change impact analysis and context extraction
- Support for new features, updates, and removals

**Usage:**
```bash
node docs-correlation-tool.mjs --since <SHA> --nx-path ../nx --output update-plan.md
```

## Additional Work

- **Installation Methods Research**: Documented 5 different approaches for accessing private GitHub repositories (`tasks/installation-methods.md`)
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced README with prerequisites, quick install section, and manual setup alternatives

## Impact

Today's work significantly improves two critical developer workflows:

1. **Raw Docs Adoption**: The one-line installer reduces setup friction from multiple manual steps to a single command, improving developer experience and adoption rates.

2. **Documentation Maintenance**: The correlation tool automates the tedious process of tracking feature changes and identifying documentation updates, enabling the docs team to maintain more accurate and up-to-date documentation with AI assistance.

## Dictations

### Nx Parallel Worktree Registry Conflicts
- **File**: `dictations/nx-parallel-worktree-registry-conflicts.md`
- **Topic**: Development Environment Issue

Documented a race condition issue that occurs with the local Verdaccio registry when working with multiple Nx features simultaneously using AI assistants. The conflict centers around `create-nx-workspace@22.0.0` when multiple processes attempt to publish packages to the local registry simultaneously from different git worktrees. Proposed solutions include registry isolation, dynamic port allocation, synchronization mechanisms, or sequential processing of Nx tasks when registry interaction is required.

## Tasks In Progress

### NX CLI Heap Usage Logging - Phase 1 ðŸš§
- **Started**: 18:35
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Plan**: `tasks/nx-heap-usage-logging-phase1.md`
- **Spec**: `specs/heap-usage-logging.md`

**Objective:**
Implement memory tracking functionality for NX CLI to display peak RSS (Resident Set Size) for each task during execution, activated via `NX_LOG_HEAP_USAGE=true` environment variable.

**Planned Steps:**
1. Add pidusage dependency for cross-platform memory tracking
2. Enhance Task interface with peakRss field
3. Create memory tracking service with 500ms polling
4. Integrate tracking into process execution
5. Update terminal output formatting
6. Build and test with canary version

**Technical Specification Highlights:**
- Cross-platform support using `pidusage` npm package
- Track aggregate memory usage of parent task process + all child processes
- Display format: `âœ“ my-app:build [local cache] 2.5s (peak: 512MB)`
- Auto-scale units (MB for <1GB, GB for â‰¥1GB)
- Comprehensive verification process including canary builds and e2e testing

## Additional Tools Created

- **analyze-generators.mjs**: Analyzes React and Vite generator schemas for configuration options
- **analyze-e2e-tests.mjs**: Analyzes e2e test patterns and configurations
- **add-port-option-react-generator.md**: Documentation for adding port configuration to React generators

## Notes

- All 7 planned implementation steps were completed successfully for the curl installation script
- Manual testing verified functionality across different scenarios
- The solution maintains backward compatibility while adding new convenience features
- GitHub CLI was chosen as the primary method due to its widespread adoption and seamless authentication handling
- The documentation-feature correlation tool represents a significant productivity enhancement for the Nx documentation team
