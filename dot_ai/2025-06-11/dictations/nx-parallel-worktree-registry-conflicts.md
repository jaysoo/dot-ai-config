# Nx Parallel Worktree Registry Conflicts

## Problem Overview

When working with multiple Nx features simultaneously using AI assistants, there's a race condition issue that occurs with the local Verdaccio registry. This problem specifically manifests when:

1. Multiple git worktrees are active in the Nx repository
2. Each worktree is running e2e or e2e-ci targets
3. All worktrees are publishing to the same local registry
4. AI is completing multiple Nx-related tasks in parallel

## Technical Details

### The Conflict

The race condition centers around `create-nx-workspace@22.0.0` when multiple processes attempt to:
- Publish packages to the local Verdaccio registry simultaneously
- Access or modify the same registry resources
- Execute e2e tests that depend on the local registry state

### Environment Setup

- **Repository**: Nx monorepo
- **Development Pattern**: Multiple git worktrees for parallel feature development
- **Testing**: e2e and e2e-ci targets
- **Registry**: Local Verdaccio instance
- **Automation**: AI completing tasks across different worktrees

## Impact

This issue only occurs when:
- AI assistants are working on multiple Nx-related tasks in parallel
- Each task involves publishing to or interacting with the local Verdaccio registry
- The timing of operations creates resource contention

## Potential Solutions to Explore

1. **Registry Isolation**: Separate Verdaccio instances per worktree
2. **Port Management**: Dynamic port allocation for each worktree's registry
3. **Synchronization**: Implement locking mechanisms for registry operations
4. **Sequential Processing**: Configure AI to handle Nx tasks sequentially when registry interaction is required

**Notes**: 
- The specific version mentioned (create-nx-workspace@22.0.0) suggests this may be version-specific behavior
- "Verdaccio" was interpreted from the dictated "verdaccior"
