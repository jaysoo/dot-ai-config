# Daily Summary - 2025-06-16

## Specifications Created

### Engineering Team Restructuring
- Created comprehensive specification for addressing critical coordination issues in engineering teams at Nx
- Proposed three-pronged approach:
  1. **"Break Glass" Process** - Lightweight emergency process for critical cross-team bottlenecks
  2. **Cloud Technical Lead Role** - Senior technical position for architectural leadership
  3. **Platform Ownership Model** - Hybrid approach with Platform Council for coordination
- Focus on maintaining existing team structures while adding coordination mechanisms that activate only when needed
- Targets reducing critical bottleneck resolution time from ~1 week to <24 hours

## Key Accomplishments
- Defined clear escalation process with roles, responsibilities, and governance structure
- Created implementation timeline spanning 6 months with specific milestones
- Established success metrics and risk mitigation strategies
- Developed incident template for standardized break glass activation

## Tasks In Progress
- Debug Migrate UI Module Resolution Issue (from 2025-06-13)
- Retrieve Notion Incident Response Pages (from 2025-06-13)
- Track Nx Docs Restructure Issue (from 2025-06-13)
- NX CLI Heap Usage Logging - Phase 1 (from 2025-06-11)

## Next Steps
- Review and approve engineering restructuring specification
- Begin communication with engineering teams
- Initiate break glass process setup
- Start Cloud tech lead recruitment
