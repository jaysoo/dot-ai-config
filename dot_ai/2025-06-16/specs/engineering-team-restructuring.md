# Engineering Team Restructuring Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification addresses critical coordination issues in engineering teams at Nx, focusing on implementing a "break glass" process for rare but impactful cross-team bottlenecks. The approach maintains existing team structures (CLI, Cloud, Infrastructure) while adding lightweight coordination mechanisms that activate only when needed.

## Current State Analysis

### Team Structure
- **CLI Team**: Node.js, Rust, IDE extensions (open source)
- **Cloud Team**: Remix app and API (closed source, built on CLI)
- **Infrastructure Team**: Supporting primarily Cloud, but also general infrastructure

### Key Pain Points
1. Cross-team dependencies cause delays up to 1 week due to weekly sync cycles
2. Cloud team lacks technical lead, creating coordination challenges
3. Team metrics penalize cross-team collaboration
4. No systematic process for handling critical bottlenecks
5. Success depends on seniority/authority to force prioritization

### What Works Well
- AI task forces succeed because they're self-contained with no external dependencies
- Most work can be siloed effectively
- Only handful of cross-functional features per year
- CLI generally has sufficient features for Cloud needs

## Proposed Solution: Three-Pronged Approach

### 1. "Break Glass" Process for Critical Bottlenecks (Priority 1)

#### Definition
A lightweight, on-demand process that activates only for critical cross-team dependencies that cannot be resolved through normal channels.

#### Triggering Criteria
- Team blocked for >4 hours on external dependency
- Revenue-impacting feature blocked
- Production incident requiring cross-team expertise
- Strategic initiative with hard deadline at risk

#### Process Flow

```
1. Initial Attempt (0-4 hours)
   - Team attempts resolution through standard channels
   - Direct Slack communication with relevant team
   - Check documentation and existing APIs

2. Escalation Decision (4 hours)
   - Team lead evaluates against triggering criteria
   - If criteria met, initiates "break glass" process

3. Break Glass Activation
   - Post in #break-glass-emergency channel
   - Use standardized template:
     * What's blocked
     * Business impact (revenue/customers affected)
     * What help is needed
     * Deadline constraints

4. Rapid Response Team Assembly (within 1 hour)
   - Pre-designated responders from each team notified
   - Virtual war room created
   - Clear owner assigned

5. Resolution
   - Direct collaboration bypassing normal processes
   - Authority to reprioritize work temporarily
   - Daily updates until resolved

6. Post-Mortem
   - Document root cause
   - Identify preventive measures
   - Update processes if needed
```

#### Roles and Responsibilities

**Break Glass Initiators** (authorized to trigger):
- Engineering Managers
- Tech Leads
- Senior Engineers (with manager approval)

**Rapid Response Team**:
- 1 senior engineer from each team (CLI, Cloud, Infrastructure)
- Rotate monthly to prevent burnout
- Compensated with reduced regular workload (10% time allocation)

**Process Owner**:
- Director of Engineering initially
- Eventually delegate to Principal Engineer

#### Governance
- Monthly review of all break glass incidents
- Quarterly process refinement
- Clear abuse escalation path
- Track metrics: frequency, resolution time, business impact

### 2. Cloud Technical Lead (Priority 2)

#### Role Definition
Senior technical position to provide architectural leadership and technical coordination for the Cloud platform.

#### Key Responsibilities
- Technical vision and architecture for Cloud platform
- Cross-team technical coordination
- Code review and technical mentorship
- Incident response leadership for Cloud issues
- API design and standards enforcement
- NOT people management (EM handles that)

#### Success Criteria
- Improved technical decision velocity
- Reduced architectural debt
- Better CLI-Cloud technical alignment
- Clearer technical escalation path

#### Implementation
- Start recruitment immediately
- Consider internal promotion first
- 3-month onboarding with overlapping support
- Clear delineation from EM responsibilities

### 3. Platform Ownership Model (Priority 3)

#### Approach: Hybrid Model
Maintain current team boundaries but add light coordination layer.

#### Structure
- **Core Teams** remain as-is (CLI, Cloud, Infrastructure)
- **Platform Council** meets bi-weekly:
  - Tech leads from each team
  - Rotating engineers (quarterly)
  - Reviews cross-team work
  - Owns break glass process
  - Defines integration standards

#### Responsibilities

**Core Teams**:
- Own their domain completely
- Handle 95% of work independently
- Maintain existing roadmaps
- Contribute to platform standards

**Platform Council**:
- Handle remaining 5% cross-team work
- Own break glass process operations
- Define API contracts between teams
- Coordinate major architectural decisions
- Review and approve cross-team dependencies

## Implementation Timeline

### Month 1
- Draft break glass process documentation
- Identify and train rapid response team
- Set up #break-glass-emergency channel
- Create incident template
- Run tabletop exercise

### Month 2
- Go live with break glass process
- Begin Cloud tech lead recruitment
- Establish Platform Council
- First council meeting

### Month 3
- First break glass post-mortem
- Onboard Cloud tech lead
- Refine process based on learnings
- Establish metrics dashboard

### Month 4-6
- Iterate on process
- Expand Platform Council scope gradually
- Measure impact on bottleneck resolution
- Consider expanding to other coordination challenges

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- Time to resolve critical bottlenecks: Target <24 hours (from current ~1 week)
- Break glass incidents per month: Target <3
- Engineer satisfaction with cross-team coordination: Target >7/10

### Secondary Metrics
- Cloud platform technical debt reduction
- API-related incidents
- Cross-team feature delivery time
- Platform Council effectiveness rating

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Process Abuse
- **Mitigation**: Clear criteria, monthly audits, escalation consequences

### Risk: Rapid Response Burnout
- **Mitigation**: Monthly rotation, 10% time allocation, recognition program

### Risk: Cloud Tech Lead Overload
- **Mitigation**: Clear scope boundaries, gradual responsibility ramp-up

### Risk: Platform Council Becomes Bottleneck
- **Mitigation**: Limited scope, time-boxed meetings, clear decision criteria

## Budget Requirements

### One-time Costs
- Cloud Tech Lead recruitment: $5-10k
- Process setup and training: 40 engineering hours

### Ongoing Costs
- Cloud Tech Lead salary: Market rate for senior technical role
- Rapid Response Team time: ~10% of 3 engineers' time
- Platform Council time: 2 hours/week per member

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Full team reorganization into feature teams**: Rejected due to concerns about platform ownership and miscellaneous work
2. **Dedicated cross-functional teams**: Rejected due to workload imbalance risks
3. **Heavy API versioning and contracts**: Rejected as too process-heavy for current stage
4. **Status quo with better communication**: Rejected as insufficient for critical bottlenecks

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve specification
2. Communicate plan to engineering teams
3. Begin break glass process setup
4. Initiate Cloud tech lead search
5. Schedule first Platform Council meeting
