## Work Performed

### nx-worktrees/DOC-184: Client-Side Routing for Old Documentation URLs
- **Branch**: DOC-184
- **Commit**: 51c0936abd
- **Linear Issue**: [DOC-184](https://linear.app/nxdev/issue/DOC-184/client-side-routing-for-old-docs-both-normal-markdown-and-generator)
- **Time**: Morning session

#### Problem Solved
Users clicking on old documentation links would see 404 pages or experience a flash of wrong content before redirects happened. This affected both normal markdown docs and generator documentation URLs.

#### Solution Implemented
Created a Link wrapper component that intercepts and transforms old URLs to new ones BEFORE navigation occurs:

1. **Created Link wrapper component** (`nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/link/`)
   - Transforms URLs based on existing redirect rules
   - Handles exact matches, wildcards (`:path*`, `:slug*`), and regex patterns
   - Preserves query parameters and hash fragments
   - Works with both internal and external URLs

2. **Updated all Link imports** across nx-dev to use the wrapper
   - Modified 23 files to use the new Link component
   - Avoided circular dependencies by placing in ui-common package
   - Used dynamic imports for redirect rules

#### Key Decisions
- **Rejected client-side redirect approach**: Initially tried using useEffect to redirect after navigation, but this caused flashing of wrong content
- **Link wrapper approach**: Better UX as URLs are transformed before navigation
- **Package location**: Placed in ui-common to avoid circular dependencies with nx-dev

#### Files Modified
- `nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/link/` (new directory with Link wrapper)
- `nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/link/link.tsx` (Link component)
- `nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/link/redirect-utils.ts` (URL transformation logic)
- `nx-dev/ui-common/src/lib/link/index.ts` (exports)
- 20+ component files updated to use new Link import
- All ui-markdoc components (link.component.tsx, heading.component.tsx, etc.)
- All ui-common header and navigation components

## Learnings & Issues

### Import Path Management
- Need to be careful with relative import paths when moving components between packages
- ui-common internal components use `./link` or `../link` 
- External packages use `@nx/nx-dev-ui-common`

### Circular Dependency Prevention
- Cannot have ui-common directly import from nx-dev
- Solution: Use dynamic require() for redirect rules to break compile-time dependency

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases with URL transformation
- Consider adding telemetry to track which old URLs are still being used
- May need to update when new redirect rules are added
