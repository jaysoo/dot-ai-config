# Summary - September 22, 2025

## Key Accomplishments

### Documentation Infrastructure
- **DOC-223: Added conditional noindex to old docs pages** - Implemented noindex meta tags for all documentation pages when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL` environment variable is set. This prevents search engines from indexing old documentation during the migration to Astro.
  - Modified DocViewer component to conditionally add noindex/nofollow
  - Updated changelog, plugin-registry, and ai-chat pages with conditional meta tags
  - Ensured all pages using DocumentationHeader respect the migration mode

## Technical Details
- Files modified: 4 files across nx-dev projects
- Added conditional logic using `!!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTRO_URL` to determine when to apply noindex
- Maintained backward compatibility - no impact when environment variable is not set

## Status
- Linear issue DOC-223 marked as Done
- Changes committed to master branch
- All documentation pages now properly handle SEO during migration phase
