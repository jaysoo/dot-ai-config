# Daily Summary - August 11, 2025

## Project: GitHub Stats Collection & Analysis

### Accomplishments

#### Monthly Productivity Analysis Debugging & Fix
- **Issue Identified**: Discovered and fixed a critical timezone bug in the monthly productivity analysis script that was causing months to display incorrectly (e.g., April showing as March)
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript `Date` constructor was interpreting dates in local timezone, shifting months backward
- **Solution**: Updated date formatting to use UTC dates throughout the script:
  ```javascript
  const [year, month] = result.month.split('-');
  const monthName = new Date(Date.UTC(parseInt(year), parseInt(month) - 1, 1))
    .toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', year: 'numeric', timeZone: 'UTC' });
  ```

#### Data Validation & Correction
- **Verified PTO Totals** for all months:
  - January 2025: 6 days
  - February 2025: 18 days  
  - March 2025: 27 days
  - April 2025: **32 days** (was incorrectly showing 73 in table)
  - May 2025: **73 days** (highest PTO month - correct)
  - June 2025: 19 days
  - July 2025: 41 days

- **April PTO Breakdown** (Engineers only):
  - Rares: 9 days
  - Max Kless: 8 days
  - Louie: 5 days
  - James: 3 days
  - Steve: 3 days
  - Jason: 2 days
  - Jack: 1 day
  - Craigory: 1 day
  - Total: 32 weekday PTO days

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `.claude/commands/monthly-productivity-scores.md` with:
  - Documentation of the timezone bug fix
  - Verified PTO totals for reference
  - Implementation notes for future runs
  - Running instructions for different scenarios

### Key Insights
- May 2025 had exceptionally high PTO (73 days) which significantly impacted productivity metrics
- April 2025 achieved the 2nd highest productivity score despite moderate PTO
- The bug fix ensures accurate month-to-month comparisons going forward

### Tools & Scripts Created
- `analyze-monthly-productivity.mjs` - Fixed main analysis script
- `analyze-april-pto.mjs` - April PTO breakdown analyzer
- `debug-april-pto.mjs` - Debugging script for PTO counts
- `check-march-april.mjs` - March/April PTO verification
- `verify-april-calculation.mjs` - April calculation validator
- `check-may-pto.mjs` - May PTO analyzer

### Impact
The fixed analysis script now provides accurate monthly productivity metrics that properly account for PTO days and normalize productivity scores across the engineering team. This enables reliable trend analysis and performance tracking.

## Status
✅ Monthly productivity analysis bug fixed and verified
✅ Documentation updated with fix details and correct data
✅ All debugging scripts created for future validation
