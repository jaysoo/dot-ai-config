# Summarize

Given today's date in `.ai/yyyy-mm-dd` folder or `dot_ai/yyyy-mm-dd` folder, whichever is found first, go through files under specs, dictations, and plans folder and summarize what was accomplished today (where `yyyy-mm-dd` is today's date). Call it `SUMMARY.md`.

Also review the `.ai/TODO.md` or `dot_ai/TODO.md` file to find any completed tasks for the day and mention them in the summary. Note that the completed task may already be in the existing summary file.

## IMPORTANT

This file should be concise, but offer a good high-level view of accomplishments for today. It will be used by:
- Me in the future to review notes and figure out what I did on certain days
- AI (like YOU) to build context around daily accomplishments in case I need to look for information on relevant tasks, specs, etc.
- My manager so I can quickly summarize what I've accomplished

The `SUMMARY.md` file may already exist. In that case, make sure the content is respected, in that existing info should be included in the updated summary without repeating information.
