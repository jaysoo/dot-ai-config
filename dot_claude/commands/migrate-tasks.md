# Migrate tasks

Look incomplete tasks from the last 7 days in `.ai/yyyy-mm-dd/SUMMARY.md` or `dot/yyyy-mm-dd/SUMMARY.md` file (whichever is present).

Move them into today's `SUMMARY.md` file, keeping the `yyyy-mm-dd` folder for today's date. Keep in mind that the file may already exist, so just keep the existing content and add new ones. Remember to de-duplicate when possible.

CRITICAL: migrate task should be annotated with `(migrated)`.
