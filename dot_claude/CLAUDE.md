# Individual Preference

These are preferences for myself (Jack Hsu - jack.hsu@gmail.com).

## IMPORTANT

- If it sounds like I'm asking you to perform a task then use @~/.claude/commands/plan-task.md
- If it sounds like I'm asking you to dictate notes then use @~/.claude/commands/dictate.md

## Pending tasks

- Store all pending tasks in `.ai/TODO.md` or `dot_ai/TODO.md` (whichever is present), and update it as things are checked off.
