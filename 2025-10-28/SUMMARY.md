## PPA Nx Project - Automated Publishing Workflow

### Accomplished
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) to add automated daily checks for new nx releases
  - Added scheduled trigger to run daily at midnight EST (5:00 UTC)
  - Created new `check-version` job that:
    - Checks npm for latest nx version
    - Verifies if published within last 24 hours
    - Checks if version already published (via git tags)
    - Outputs version and publish decision
  - Updated `publish-ppa` job to use version from `check-version` output
  - Added `tag-release` job to create git tags after successful publish
  - Workflow now supports both manual triggers (with version input) and automated daily checks

### Technical Details
- Schedule: Daily at midnight EST using cron `0 5 * * *`
- Version tracking: Uses git tags (format: `v{VERSION}`) to prevent duplicate publishes
- Backward compatibility: Manual workflow_dispatch triggers still work as before
- Multi-series support: Continues to build for both Ubuntu noble (24.04 LTS) and jammy (22.04 LTS)

### Impact
The PPA will now automatically publish new nx versions to Launchpad within 24 hours of their npm release, without manual intervention.
